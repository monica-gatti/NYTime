Nearly 80 percent of suicides are among men, with males over age 75 and those who work in traditionally blue collar jobs, such as mining, construction and agriculture, having the highest rates.Despite men's higher risk of death related to mental illness, women are more likely to seek out help. In 2020, 15 percent of men reported receiving either psychotropic medications or therapy in the past year compared with 26 percent of women.This disparity in care has left experts scrambling for ways to reach more men, particularly those most at risk and who might be reluctant to talk about their mental health. Research has found that men who exhibit traditional stereotypes of masculinity, such as stoicism and self-reliance, are even less likely to ask for help.\u201cWe call some of them \u2018double jeopardy men,\u2019\u201d said Sally Spencer-Thomas, president and co-founder of United Suicide Survivors International. \u201cThey\u2019re men who have a number of risk factors and who are also least likely to seek help on their own.\u201dIn response to this growing mental health crisis, the American Psychological Association (A.P.A.) released its first set of guidelines for practitioners working with men and boys in 2018. \u201cThere is clearly growing recognition that we have to reframe mental health care and our approach to addressing the mental health needs of men,\u201d wrote Arthur Evans Jr., the chief executive at A.P.A., in an email. \u201cEarly indications are that when we do this, men are willing to engage in addressing their mental health challenges.\u201d For instance, he said, it helps to reframe therapy as an opportunity to become strong or well, rather than a treatment for mental illness.Some therapists and public health campaigns have adopted this approach and are using other unconventional messaging in an attempt to appeal to hard-to-reach men. This might include using humor or leaning into some masculine stereotypes. (Think: fewer feelings, more sports analogies.) Experts hope that once these men are in the door, they\u2019ll come to see that asking for help and going to therapy is a sign of strength, not weakness.Over the course of two years, Dr. Spencer-Thomas conducted interviews and focus groups with men who had survived suicide attempts about what might have helped them during their time of greatest need. She quickly learned that the standard communication around mental health was a turnoff for the men she spoke to.\u201cOne of the things they said was, \u2018You know that message you mental health people like to put out there, \u201cIf you\u2019re depressed, seek help\u201d? That misses us on both counts,\u2019\u201d Dr. Spencer-Thomas said.For one thing, the double jeopardy men she interviewed did not consider themselves to be mentally unwell, so language about depression or mental illness didn\u2019t resonate. Instead, they said the source of their problems was an overwhelming world \u2014 stressful jobs, financial concerns, conflicts with their partner and worries about their kids.The second issue was that these men had been conditioned to be the strong ones, the ones that other people lean on. So the idea of seeking help, especially for their minds, was a foreign and off-putting concept.\u201cI don\u2019t want to say it\u2019s harder for men, because everyone deals with their own struggles, but I think the stigma around it is that men don\u2019t need to go to therapy,\u201d said Rafael G\u00f3mez Jr., 22, who works at a software company in Los Angeles. G\u00f3mez started going to therapy after temporarily moving back home during the pandemic, something he initially hid from his parents.Using the insights from her research, Dr. Spencer-Thomas partnered with the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment and the branding agency Cactus in 2012 to develop a public health campaign, called Man Therapy, that they hoped would engage men who identify with more traditional concepts of masculinity.Man Therapy, despite its name, is not intended to be a replacement for formal mental health care. It\u2019s a website designed to educate, reduce stigma and encourage men to seek help in times of crisis. In addition to providing links to the National Suicide and Crisis Lifeline and a therapist finder tool, the website also offers a screening questionnaire to help men evaluate their mental state and self-help tips.These resources are fairly standard for mental health websites; it\u2019s Man Therapy\u2019s tone that is unique, using humor and masculine stereotypes to draw in men. Slogans splashed across the home page include, \u201cIt\u2019s OK to cry, even when it\u2019s not about sports\u201d and \u201cFeelings: they\u2019re not just for the hippies.\u201d A mustachioed fictional therapist, Rich Mahogany, who strongly resembles the \u201cParks and Recreation\u201d character Ron Swanson, guides users through the site.\u201cRather than trying to change hundreds of years of social norming for these men, we decided instead to try to meet men where they were,\u201d said Jarrod Hindman, a co-founder of Man Therapy and currently chief operating officer at Sources of Strength, a youth suicide prevention program.Man Therapy has developed numerous partnerships over the years to promote the site, including with government-funded health organizations in 15 states; professional groups in male-dominated industries, such as construction and transportation; and private mental health companies, including BetterHelp. Men might see advertisements for the site on billboards, on coasters in bars or even in bathrooms at sports arenas.A recent evaluation of the campaign suggests that it is fairly effective. Men who visited Man Therapy, as compared to a more conventional suicide awareness and screening site, were more likely to take part in help-seeking behaviors, such as starting therapy, being seen by a primary care physician for mental health reasons or participating in a mental health support group.Many men go to therapy willingly and openly. But for those who are resistant to the idea, getting them into a professional\u2019s office is only half the battle. Persuading them to talk can be another challenge.John D\u2019Agostini, 38, who runs a leadership program for young men near Minneapolis, tried going to several counselors throughout his 20s and early 30s, but he found the sessions very difficult. \u201cIt had nothing to do with them, it was me,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t have the skills and I didn\u2019t have the humility.\u201dThis type of resistance can be more common among men, said Mitch Abrams, a psychologist specializing in anger management who treats patients in New York and New Jersey. \u201cThey come in and they say, \u2018I\u2019m only here because my wife told me to.\u2019\u201dTo encourage these men to engage in the process, Dr. Abrams tries to help them see that although someone else might have initially recommended therapy, they wouldn\u2019t be in his office if they hadn\u2019t made the choice to be. \u201cThere are a lot of guys that know they want to be there, but they don\u2019t feel that they\u2019re allowed to say it because their pride is in the way,\u201d he said.Mr. D\u2019Agostini finally made progress when he found a therapist he felt he could open up to. \u201cI didn\u2019t feel like I had to keep up appearances,\u201d he said. \u201cI could just really drop it and be really honest and vulnerable with another human being.\u201dNiall Geoghegan, a therapist based in Berkeley, Calif., said when he works with new male clients, he\u2019s less likely to talk about emotions. \u201cA lot of people bristle against that stereotypical, \u2018How do you feel?\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s not always helpful for many people, but it\u2019s specifically not helpful for a lot of men.\u201dInstead, Dr. Geoghegan will begin by asking about their sleep, appetite and motivation, which can be indicators of depression or anxiety.As the therapy continues, Dr. Geoghegan said the men he sees are just as willing and able to go as deep as the women. Many men might say, \u201cI\u2019m not in touch with my feelings,\u201d Dr. Geoghegan said, \u201cbut after a few sessions, they\u2019d find things just pouring out.\u201dAnother challenge facing not only men but anyone wanting to see a therapist is finding a local practitioner who\u2019s taking new clients. Despite being located in the Bay Area, Dr. Geoghegan fields inquiries for teletherapy from men all over the country. He said that sometimes these men worry they\u2019ll experience stigma if they\u2019re seen seeking help locally, so teletherapy can be a more attractive option.The point of initially playing into traditional ideas of masculinity is to get hard-to-reach men to start to question some of the gender norms that no longer serve them, Dr. Spencer-Thomas said.Man Therapy\u2019s ultimate goal, she said, is \u201cto show these men that while those norms might work for you in some situations, they\u2019re not working here\u201d and then introduce a different approach.Dr. Abrams has a similar objective. \u201cWhat I try to do for men is I recalibrate their idea of what being tough is,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not a sign of strength or toughness to avoid problems that are destroying your life. It\u2019s a sign of toughness when you confront them.\u201d"}, {"slug_name": "08WELL-NL-HOLIDAZE-ONSITE", "section": "Well", "subsection": "Mind", "title": "How to Fend Off Holiday Stress, from People Who Should Know", "abstract": "A UPS driver, a baker and Santa\u2019s helper share advice for staying present through the season.", "uri": "nyt://article/c9ad8eb7-3a9c-526c-a854-fe867a600c1c", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/08/well/mind/holiday-stress-relief.html", "byline": "BY JANCEE DUNN", "thumbnail_standard": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/12/08/well/08-NL-HOLIDAYSTRESS/08-NL-HOLIDAYSTRESS-thumbStandard-v2.jpg", "item_type": "Article", "source": "New York Times", "updated_date": "2022-12-09T21:45:24-05:00", "created_date": "2022-12-08T20:00:09-05:00", "published_date": "2022-12-08T20:00:09-05:00", "first_published_date": "2022-12-08T20:00:09-05:00", "material_type_facet": "News", "kicker": "", "subheadline": "", "des_facet": ["internal-sub-only-nl", "Christmas", "Holidays and Special Occasions", "Content Type: Service", "Newsletters", "Santa Claus", "Anxiety and Stress"], "org_facet": null, "per_facet": null, "geo_facet": null, "related_urls": null, "multimedia": [{"url": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/12/08/well/08-NL-HOLIDAYSTRESS/08-NL-HOLIDAYSTRESS-thumbStandard-v2.jpg", "format": "Standard Thumbnail", "height": 75, "width": 75, "type": "image", "subtype": "photo", "caption": "", "copyright": "Illustration by Ricardo Santos; Photographs by Getty Images"}, {"url": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/12/08/well/08-NL-HOLIDAYSTRESS/08-NL-HOLIDAYSTRESS-mediumThreeByTwo210-v2.jpg", "format": "mediumThreeByTwo210", "height": 140, "width": 210, "type": "image", "subtype": "photo", "caption": "", "copyright": "Illustration by Ricardo Santos; Photographs by Getty Images"}, {"url": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/12/08/well/08-NL-HOLIDAYSTRESS/08-NL-HOLIDAYSTRESS-mediumThreeByTwo440-v2.jpg", "format": "mediumThreeByTwo440", "height": 293, "width": 440, "type": "image", "subtype": "photo", "caption": "", "copyright": "Illustration by Ricardo Santos; Photographs by Getty Images"}, {"url": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/12/08/well/08-NL-HOLIDAYSTRESS/08-NL-HOLIDAYSTRESS-articleInline-v2.jpg", "format": "Normal", "height": 127, "width": 190, "type": "image", "subtype": "photo", "caption": "", "copyright": "Illustration by Ricardo Santos; Photographs by Getty Images"}]}, {"slug_name": "08WELL-STIFF-PERSON-SYNDROME", "section": "Well", "subsection": "Live", "title": "What Is Stiff Person Syndrome?", "abstract": "Celine Dion canceled her upcoming tour after being diagnosed with this rare neurological condition.
