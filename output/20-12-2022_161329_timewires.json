Although it is unclear exactly when and where the term was coined, it was popularized in a 2001 episode of \u201cFriends,\u201d when the character Joey Tribbiani ate an entire turkey, wiped his forehead and said, \u201cHere come the meat sweats.\u201d More recently, in June 2022, the fast food chain Arby\u2019s teamed up with Old Spice to sell a \u201cMeat Sweat Defense\u201d kit, which included a custom roast beef sweatsuit, gym towel, sweatband and a can of deodorant spray.But is this just clever marketing, or will scarfing one too many roast beef sandwiches really make you sweat like you just ran a marathon?Research suggests that eating protein does raise body temperature more than eating carbohydrates or fats. Yet there\u2019s little evidence to suggest that this increase is large enough to incite sweating, said Donald Layman, a professor emeritus of food science and human nutrition who studies protein metabolism at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. So the phenomenon may be rooted more in myth than reality. Here\u2019s what we know.Some evidence suggests that protein-rich meals turn up the (body) heat, though most studies on the issue are small and from decades ago. In one landmark study published in 2002, for instance, researchers from Arizona State University asked 10 young women to eat either high-protein or high-carbohydrate meals for one day and took various measurements, including body temperature. Then, either four or eight weeks later, the women came back to the lab and ate the other meal option. The women\u2019s body temperatures were nearly 60 percent higher, on average, after eating the more protein-heavy dinner. Other small studies have suggested that the same thing happens in men.Protein increases body temperature because your body must do more work \u2014 meaning exert more energy \u2014 to digest it, and this work also releases heat, said Marie-Pierre St-Onge, an associate professor of nutritional medicine at the Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons.That\u2019s in part because protein is more difficult to break down than carbs or fats. Protein digestion is \u201cenergetically expensive,\u201d said Stuart Phillips, a kinesiologist and director of the McMaster Centre for Nutrition, Exercise and Health Research at McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario.Our bodies use the proteins we eat to generate new proteins, too \u2014 and this process also produces heat, Dr. Layman said.After you eat at least 30 grams of protein, for instance, your body starts to make its own muscle proteins, which \u201cis a very energy expensive process,\u201d Dr. Layman explained. \u201cThat will increase heat expenditure in the body,\u201d meaning that it will make you feel hot.Since so much of the energy from high-protein meals is quickly used by the body, a person burns three to four times as many calories after eating protein compared with eating carbohydrates or fat, Dr. Layman said. In one small study published in 1999, researchers found that when eight women followed a diet high in protein for one day, they burned an average of 87 more calories than when they followed a diet high in fat.One theory with only limited evidence is that we may be warmed more by meals we enjoy than those we don\u2019t. In a small study published in 1985, eight women consumed either a palatable meal of cheese fondue, spaghetti with meatballs, a chocolate \u00e9clair and a soda, or they consumed the same foods blended and formed into a flavorless, dry biscuit. The next day, the women switched and consumed the other meal. The researchers found that the women\u2019s bodies released about half as much heat after eating the tasteless biscuit compared with the delicious feast. Though this study does not seem to have been repeated since.Although protein does warm the body, experts aren\u2019t convinced that eating lots of meat \u2014 even if delicious \u2014 will cause a person to sweat much, if at all.\u201cMeat sweats are not a thing,\u201d Dr. Layman said. In the studies that have been done, he added, \u201cno one has ever reported sweating.\u201dMeat may not induce sweating because, although protein does increase body temperature more than other macronutrients do, the relative temperature increase is quite small. The body temperatures of the women in the 2002 study were only 0.2 to 0.3 degrees higher, on average, after following the protein-heavy diet.Dr. St-Onge, who was not even familiar with the term \u201cmeat sweats,\u201d said that it\u2019s possible that a person might slightly perspire after eating lots of meat, but \u201cI don\u2019t think that people would start sweating profusely,\u201d she said.However, if you gorge on meat while you\u2019re already feeling hot, that could tip you over the edge, she added. \u201cIf you have a high-meat meal in the middle of summer in Midtown Manhattan, outside, and it\u2019s like 90 degrees, yes, you will sweat,\u201d she said."}, {"slug_name": "20-WELL-HOLIDAY-LONELINESS", "section": "Well", "subsection": "Family", "title": "Simple Steps for Managing Holiday Loneliness", "abstract": "Whether you\u2019re physically apart from your loved ones or feeling isolated in a sea of friends and family, these strategies can help.", "uri": "nyt://article/3fa020af-fc07-57f9-aed6-05a8e43de59b", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/20/well/family/holiday-loneliness.html", "byline": "BY CATHERINE PEARSON", "thumbnail_standard": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/12/09/well/09Well-Holiday-Loneliness/09Well-Holiday-Loneliness-thumbStandard.jpg", "item_type": "Article", "source": "New York Times", "updated_date": "2022-12-20T05:00:12-05:00", "created_date": "2022-12-20T05:00:12-05:00", "published_date": "2022-12-20T05:00:12-05:00", "first_published_date": "2022-12-20T05:00:12-05:00", "material_type_facet": "News", "kicker": "", "subheadline": "", "des_facet": ["Holidays and Special Occasions", "Loneliness", "Dating and Relationships", "Psychology and Psychologists", "Friendship", "Families and Family Life"], "org_facet": null, "per_facet": null, "geo_facet": null, "related_urls": null, "multimedia": [{"url": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/12/09/well/09Well-Holiday-Loneliness/09Well-Holiday-Loneliness-thumbStandard.jpg", "format": "Standard Thumbnail", "height": 75, "width": 75, "type": "image", "subtype": "photo", "caption": "", "copyright": "Stasele Jakunskaite"}, {"url": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/12/09/well/09Well-Holiday-Loneliness/09Well-Holiday-Loneliness-mediumThreeByTwo210.jpg", "format": "mediumThreeByTwo210", "height": 140, "width": 210, "type": "image", "subtype": "photo", "caption": "", "copyright": "Stasele Jakunskaite"}, {"url": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/12/09/well/09Well-Holiday-Loneliness/09Well-Holiday-Loneliness-mediumThreeByTwo440.jpg", "format": "mediumThreeByTwo440", "height": 293, "width": 440, "type": "image", "subtype": "photo", "caption": "", "copyright": "Stasele Jakunskaite"}, {"url": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/12/09/well/09Well-Holiday-Loneliness/09Well-Holiday-Loneliness-articleInline.jpg", "format": "Normal", "height": 127, "width": 190, "type": "image", "subtype": "photo", "caption": "", "copyright": "Stasele Jakunskaite"}], "body": "The holidays are a time for joy and togetherness, but for many they can also spur feelings of loneliness. There aren\u2019t comprehensive statistics for how many people feel starved for connection this time of year, but there are clues: A 2017 AARP survey, for instance, found that 31 percent of adults aged 18 and older have felt lonely during the holidays. And the past few holiday seasons have been especially fraught: The Covid-19 pandemic has led to a global uptick in loneliness, which experts describe as the difference between how much connection a person wants and how much they\u2019re actually getting.\u201cLoneliness and aloneness are not the same thing,\u201d said Kory Floyd, a professor of communication at the University of Arizona and the author of \u201cThe Loneliness Cure.\u201d Loneliness is subjective. During the holidays, you can be surrounded by friends and family and feel totally isolated. Alternatively, you can be alone and feel completely at peace.Everyone is lonely from time to time, and it makes sense that, for some, this feeling peaks around the holidays, when expectations run high, said Julianne Holt-Lunstad, a professor of psychology and neuroscience at Brigham Young University. She noted that loneliness is biologically motivated \u2014 a kind of internal alarm bell that drives us to meet our basic need for connection. In that sense, short bouts of loneliness are as much a part of the human experience as feeling hungry or thirsty, Dr. Holt-Lunstad said. (Chronic loneliness is different because it is more prolonged, she said, and can be treated effectively through cognitive behavioral therapy.)When loneliness hits, it is possible to help yourself through it and lighten the feeling, experts say. These five strategies can help.Volunteering is a proven buffer against stress and depressive symptoms and can be particularly effective in lessening feelings of isolation. That is because loneliness tends to draw people\u2019s attention inward, while giving back turns it outward, Dr. Floyd said.\u201cYou are focusing on the joy and comfort you can bring to others,\u201d he added.There are usually plenty of opportunities to volunteer this time of year. Websites like VolunteerMatch and AmeriCorps can also direct you to in-person and virtual options.Informal gestures help ease feelings of isolation, as well. Dr. Holt-Lunstad led research showing that performing small acts of kindness toward neighbors \u2014 like dropping off groceries, watering their plants or simply chatting for a bit \u2014 can help people feel less solitary.\u201cJust these small little things were enough to show small improvements in loneliness,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s something that\u2019s really easy, that anyone can do.\u201dThere is growing research linking creative expression to reduced loneliness, Dr. Holt-Lunstad said. For example, a recent study found that during the pandemic, people have reported feeling less lonely on days they were more creative than usual, even if they did the activity solo.Creative expression can take many forms, Dr. Holt-Lunstad said. You might paint or craft. Perhaps you write or play an instrument. Maybe you finally take on that D.I.Y. project in your home.If creativity does not come naturally to you, Dr. Holt-Lunstad noted, you can still reap the benefits by spending time around others who are doing creative things. For example, she said, you could go to a holiday concert or performance. That has the added reward of getting you out of the house and putting you in the company of others. Social isolation and loneliness are not synonymous but are linked.The fantasy of endless holiday magic and deep, meaningful reunions with loved ones can set anyone up for feelings of disappointment.Dr. Floyd suggested \u201creframing,\u201d a tactic he uses often in his own life. It is all about challenging your self-talk to shift your perspective by asking yourself: What is an unhealthy narrative running through my head right now, and how could I change it? For instance, if you are having a small family get-together, concentrate on appreciating the people who are attending rather than focusing on those who are not. If you are away from home and missing a favorite tradition, make a list of other elements of the season that bring you joy and direct your attention to them. Dr. Floyd recommended jotting everything down and returning to that reframing exercise in moments when you feel yourself slipping back into negative thought patterns.Gratitude can also serve as a powerful antidote to loneliness, Dr. Holt-Lunstad said, because it helps you focus your thoughts on what you have rather than on what you are lacking. Write down what you are grateful for, or tell someone you appreciate them, which has the added bonus of fostering connection.\u201cLet people know how much they mean to you,\u201d she said.If you\u2019re spending more time alone than you\u2019d like, make an effort to do something with that time that feels indulgent, Dr. Floyd said. Take a walk in the moonlight. Get lost in a book. Bake your favorite dessert and eat it right away.\u201cTurn the experience of aloneness into something positive,\u201d Dr. Floyd said.Michelle Munson, a professor at New York University\u2019s Silver School of Social Work who studies social isolation, said it is a good practice to plan ahead for when difficult feelings arise.\u201cHave a set of \u2018go-to\u2019 activities that make you feel good,\u201d she said, adding that you should make an effort to be mindful during those moments. So take deep breaths and savor those experiences.One of the hard parts about feeling lonely around the holidays is the sense that you\u2019re the only one in that position. All of the experts interviewed for this story said it can be helpful to remind yourself that it\u2019s simply not true. And while strategies like reframing and cultivating gratitude can help mitigate loneliness and sorrow, it is also important not to deny your feelings.\u201cThe holidays are a time when we reflect on relationships that are lost,\u201d Dr. Floyd said. You might be missing someone who has passed away, or a family member with whom you no longer have contact.Be gentle with yourself.\u201cI think what can be comforting to us, as humans, is to allow ourselves to feel the longing and the loss and even the loneliness,\u201d Dr. Munson said, \u201cas opposed to feeling embarrassed or ashamed about the feelings we experience.\u201d"}, {"slug_name":

cases are experiencing a nationwide uptick. Together, these three respiratory illnesses are overwhelming hospitals and disrupting schools and offices.They\u2019re also driving demand for fever- and pain-reducing medications. In recent weeks, some families have struggled to find children\u2019s acetaminophen (Tylenol) and ibuprofen (Advil or Motrin). Johnson & Johnson \u2014 which makes Children\u2019s Tylenol and Children\u2019s Motrin \u2014 said in a statement to The New York Times that there is no nationwide shortage, but increased demand means \u201cproducts may be less readily available at some stores.\u201d The company said it was maximizing production capacity while continuously shipping products out to retailers.Meanwhile, CVS and Walgreens are limiting purchases of children\u2019s fever- and pain-reducing medications to ensure continued access for families. These developments may sound concerning, especially as parents scramble to find the appropriate medicines to help sick children get through this winter\u2019s viruses. But experts say that there are only a couple of items that are really essential for managing headaches, fevers, coughs and runny or stuffy noses if anyone gets sick. And you don\u2019t need to stockpile a lot of any one medicine, said Rebekah Wrenn, coordinator for infectious diseases pharmacy services at Duke University Hospital. \u201cYou just need to have enough for your family for a potential week of symptoms.\u201dHere is what doctors recommend for soothing flu, Covid and R.S.V. symptoms at home (in addition to first aid items, other medicines you typically use and Covid tests or pulse oximeters that may be useful for figuring out when to isolate or go to a doctor).The first item that many experts recommend is a digital multi-use stick thermometer, a temporal (or forehead) thermometer or both. A fever can be one of the earliest signs of a viral infection, and being able to objectively measure when your temperature starts rising and how much it spikes can help you figure out how to manage symptoms, as well as how long you may be contagious.Digital multi-use stick thermometers provide quick, easy-to-read body temperature measurements for people of all ages. They can be used orally for adults and children as young as 4 and under the armpit for anyone (though the American Academy of Pediatrics cautions that armpit temperatures are not always accurate). Multi-use thermometers can also record rectally, which produces the most accurate readings for young children, particularly those under 3 months old.Temporal thermometers are a good choice for adults and kids because they can measure heat waves coming off the temporal artery in the forehead within seconds, said Dr. Sarah Adams, a pediatrician with Akron Children\u2019s Hospital in Ohio. (In-ear and contactless infrared thermometers are other options, but Dr. Adams said they can be more challenging to use accurately.)It can be useful to have two different types of thermometers at your disposal so you can compare them if a reading seems off, Dr. Adams said. But even if you have just one, using it to take repeated measurements over time, rather than just doing a single reading, can help you ensure the temperatures you\u2019re seeing are accurate.These come in two categories: acetaminophen (sold under the brand name Tylenol) and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen (sold under the brand name Advil or Motrin).According to Dr. Adams, it\u2019s a good idea to have both on hand. \u201cThey\u2019re two completely different medications\u201d in relation to how they work in the body, she said. Acetaminophen only helps ease pain and fever, while ibuprofen also reduces inflammation.You can use acetaminophen or ibuprofen interchangeably \u2014 it all boils down to personal preference, Dr. Wrenn said. You may choose one over the other to avoid interactions with other medicines you take, or to steer clear of side effects you or your child may have experienced in the past \u2014 like stomach pain with ibuprofen. You can also choose based on the formulation: Adult pain- and fever-reducers come in various types of pills; children\u2019s medicines come in chewable tablet or liquid form.You can alternate between acetaminophen and ibuprofen if one doesn\u2019t sufficiently bring your fever down and you still have some time before you can take the next dose, Dr. Wrenn said. It\u2019s best to avoid high doses or prolonged use of either medication, so pay close attention to the dosing directions and frequency listed for each and don\u2019t hesitate to ask a doctor or pharmacist for help, Dr. Wrenn said.First, take a breath: Doctors stress that there\u2019s generally no medical need to bring a fever down unless it\u2019s higher than 103 degrees \u2014 or is making you or your child miserable. \u201cIt\u2019s your body\u2019s response to infection,\u201d said Dr. Michael Chang, a pediatric infectious disease specialist at Memorial Hermann Health System in Houston. That\u2019s true for both adults and children, he said, though the children\u2019s fever-reducing medicines may be harder to find than adult versions right now.Pay attention to your child\u2019s behavior. If they are generally sleeping, eating and drinking well, experts said it is best to let the fever run its course. The A.A.P. offers guidelines to help parents determine whether a child\u2019s fever warrants a call to the pediatrician. However, experts do acknowledge that fever reducers can be helpful for young, nonverbal children because it can be harder to tell when they are feeling uncomfortable and are unable to sleep or eat because of their illness.If you need to use a fever reducer, you can try a Food and Drug Administration-approved generic version. Generics work the same way as name-brands; choose whichever fever reducer is available that works for your family and situation.\u201cI just look at the package to see if it is a product that\u2019s telling me I have to dose it every two hours, especially if I\u2019m getting it for a child who\u2019s really not interested in taking it. Or is it something that has a similar effect and is more long acting?\u201d Dr. Wrenn said.You can also try non-pharmaceutical interventions. Focus on keeping your child well-hydrated, said Dr. Misbah Keen, a professor and executive vice chair of family medicine with UW Medicine in Seattle, Washington. Place a washcloth rinsed with tepid water on their forehead. Dress them in lightweight clothing and keep the room at a comfortably cool temperature.Older children may be able to take adult ibuprofen or acetaminophen tablets but you may need to cut them to achieve the correct dosage, Dr. Keen said. The A.A.P. has dosing guidelines based on age and weight. He emphasized it is best to check with your child\u2019s pediatrician or family physician first.If you are experiencing congestion, try a saline spray or drops to help loosen up and remove mucus from your nose, said Dr. Dana Mazo, an infectious diseases specialist and clinical associate professor of medicine at NYU Langone Health. This can also help relieve coughing and sore throat symptoms that are often triggered, at least in part, by accumulated excess mucus draining back into your throat, creating a condition called postnasal drip.Saline sprays or drops are particularly helpful for children under 4 who may not be able to blow their nose and who should not be given over-the-counter cough and cold medicines because of the risk of side effects, Dr. Adams said. You can also use a saline spray alongside other home remedies that bring relief to irritated noses and throats, such as nasal aspirators, cool mist humidifiers, warm teas or honey. (Honey should not be given to babies younger than 12 months because of the risk of infant botulism.)Some experts recommend combination cough and congestion relief medicines for adults; others prefer to use separate drugs for each symptom. \u201cIt really depends on what symptoms a patient is having,\u201d Dr. Wrenn said. \u201cIf they have the trifecta of fever, pain, cough and congestion, they may need a combination product. If they just have one symptom at a time, which is usually the way these respiratory illnesses progress, then I would just use one drug at a time.\u201dCombination cough and cold medicines like DayQuil or Theraflu often have a mix of acetaminophen for fever relief, dextromethorphan for cough containment and phenylephrine for nasal decongestion. Some varieties may also include an antihistamine to help open your nasal passages, but they may make you drowsy or the packaging will direct you to take it only at night.If you do decide to take a combination drug, be sure to read the ingredients and adhere to the dosage directions to avoid unintentionally double dosing with a fever reducer like acetaminophen. Other than that, the brand of the drug doesn\u2019t really matter.\u201cWe\u2019ve all had many colds and respiratory viruses in our lives and have tried different things to treat them,\u201d Dr. Mazo said. \u201cIf you\u2019ve found in the past that one brand seems to work better for you or a decongestant works better alone compared to a combination drug, I think taking that is fine.\u201dWhat experts do agree on is that you should go through your medicine cabinet (or safe storage space) at least twice a year, if not more frequently, and throw out drugs that are expired so you can be confident the medicines you have will work.\u201cEvery season it\u2019s a good idea to check what you have on hand,\u201d Dr. Adams said."}, {"slug_name": "16WELL-EGAN-CONCERT", "section": "Well", "subsection": "Family", "title": "How a Dreaded Holiday Tradition Turned Into the Best One", "abstract": "Grief and loss may make this time of year difficult, but that pain can lessen with time.", "uri": "nyt://article/e4bfa7fe-20a1-54d9-9887-75289640c7a3", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/16/well/family/holiday-music-tradition-grief.html", "byline": "BY ELISABETH EGAN", "thumbnail_standard": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/12/16/well/16Egan-Traditions/16Egan-Traditions-thumbStandard.jpg", "item_type": "Article", "source": "New York Times", "updated_date": "2022-12-16T05:00:11-05:00", "created_date": "2022-12-16T05:00:11-05:00", "published_date": "2022-12-16T05:00:11-05:00", "first_published_date": "2022-12-16T05:00:11-05:00", "material_type_facet": "News", "kicker": "", "subheadline": "", "des_facet": ["Music", "Christmas", "Holidays and Special Occasions"], "org_facet": null, "per_facet": null, "geo_facet": null, "related_urls": null, "multimedia": [{"url": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/12/16/well/16Egan-Traditions/16Egan-Traditions-thumbStandard.jpg", "format": "Standard Thumbnail", "height": 75, "width": 75, "type": "image", "subtype": "photo", "caption": "", "copyright": "Maria Medem"}, {"url": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/12/16/well/16Egan-Traditions/16Egan-Traditions-mediumThreeByTwo210.jpg", "format": "mediumThreeByTwo210", "height": 140, "width": 210, "type": "image", "subtype": "photo", "caption": "", "copyright": "Maria Medem"}, {"url": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/12/16/well/16Egan-Traditions/16Egan-Traditions-mediumThreeByTwo440.jpg", "format": "mediumThreeByTwo440", "height": 293, "width": 440, "type": "image", "subtype": "photo", "caption": "", "copyright": "Maria Medem"}, {"url": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/12/16/well/16Egan-Traditions/16Egan-Traditions-articleInline.jpg", "format": "Normal", "height": 127, "width": 190, "type": "image", "subtype": "photo", "caption": "", "copyright": "Maria Medem"}], "body": "My mom\u2019s choir was halfway through its carol concert when I realized that her name was missing from the program. I knew she wouldn\u2019t be too broken up about it \u2014 she\u2019d say \u201cNo need to go into a swivet\u201d \u2014 but I was incensed. The oversight instantly became a referendum on everything we\u2019d lost that year.This was my mom\u2019s choir debut, and her long white hair glowed beatifically as she belted \u201cWe Three Kings\u201d on a riser beneath the pulpit where, 10 months before, my sister and I had eulogized our 59-year-old dad. The concert was the first event she\u2019d been excited about since then. She\u2019d reminded me of the date and time on multiple occasions, assuring me and my husband that nobody would care if our toddlers made a ruckus.Now, sitting in a pew my kids had decorated with stickers, I thought of my mom\u2019s calls after Thursday night rehearsals \u2014 her excitement about difficult hymns and new friends. \u201cThey\u2019re really kicking my butt,\u201d she said, as if she\u2019d joined the Olympic gymnastics team. I pictured the piles of sheet music spread across her dining room table; the stream of choral classics pouring from her record player; and her first solo Christmas tree, waiting to be decorated after the concert. How proud she was that she\u2019d put up the lights alone.When my dad died, I distracted myself from the dull toothache of grief by attempting to micromanage my mom\u2019s future. She\u2019d been his tireless caretaker through five years of throat cancer treatment, including surgery to remove his vocal cords. She was only 57; she had so much to look forward to! Eighteen years later, I still cringe when I think of the cheery way I coached my mom through those first months of widowhood.I proposed Spanish classes and piano lessons, tennis clinics and book clubs. Why not volunteer at an animal shelter? Adopt a puppy? Better yet, train a Seeing Eye dog. No matter that my mom already kowtowed to a pair of cantankerous cats and never showed a whisker of interest in canines.Then there were the cancer-inspired proposals: A bereavement group? Volunteering for hospice? Becoming a Eucharistic minister? I reminded my mom of the woman who\u2019d made the rounds at the hospital, offering Communion from a little wooden box. When we explained that my dad couldn\u2019t take anything by mouth, she sat down to watch a round of \u201cJeopardy,\u201d giving us the exact blessing we needed, a fresh face in our midst.My mom responded to all my suggestions the same way: \u201cWe\u2019ll discuss it later,\u201d which meant that we would never talk about it again.But, about a month after the funeral, she did offer to babysit one afternoon a week \u2014 three hours, max, with none of my \u201cridiculous limits\u201d on television. And she joined the choir at Our Lady of Sorrows in South Orange, N.J., the church she\u2019d been a member of for 25 years. This is where she\u2019d taught catechism (insisting that I call her Mrs. Egan when I was her student); where I reluctantly served as one of the first altar girls in the Archdiocese of Newark (a role my mom hailed as an important step for women while keeping it a secret from my grandfather, who still said the Nicene Creed in Latin); and where, for 20 years, our family knelt in a side pew every Sunday during 11 o\u2019clock mass.When my sister and I defected in the \u201990s, our parents switched to a church with air conditioning and short sermons. But Sorrows was where I headed on autopilot after being dispatched to fetch a priest in the final hours of my dad\u2019s life \u2014 and it was the church my mom returned to as the curtain opened on her life without him. It has the acoustics of a cathedral and an organ that plays chords you can feel in your gut. At Christmas, it is bedecked with ribbon, holly and hillocks of poinsettias so abundant, they make the jumbo baptismal font look like a thimble.Elegant setting and gorgeous music notwithstanding, I started dreading the next year\u2019s concert as soon as the first one ended. Of course I forgave the person who compiled the program; I hadn\u2019t taken leave of all the pillars of Catholicism (just the guilt). The real sticking point for me was the contrast of my mom singing \u201cSilent Night\u201d with the memory of my dad struggling to communicate after his surgery. His frustration was unspeakable, unforgettable, imprinted on my DNA. I\u2019d made an uneasy peace with an empty seat at the table, but a crowded pew was too much; my dad\u2019s absence took up the whole bench. Sitting there flanked by toddlers who wouldn\u2019t remember their grandfather, I felt like Our Lady of Sorrows herself.The following December, I plotted an array of traditions intended to stave off this sadness: holiday cards, an Advent calendar, cookies in every shape, size and sprinkle color. I even dragged my kids to a lightly-advertised winter solstice soiree at the Starbucks I used as an office, thinking it would be good for them to see where I worked. When I asked the barista what time the festivities would start (the store was empty), she sliced a lemon loaf, plunked it on a cardboard plate and said, flatly, \u201cHow about now.\u201dWe left after a steel drum version of \u201cO Little Town of Bethlehem\u201d came on \u2014 holiday music was still my weakness \u2014 only to find that our car had been towed. In my haste to get to my fake party, I\u2019d parked in a bus stop.The choir concert loomed on my calendar in red ink. Every time my mom left my house, she made sure I knew where to sit and how impossible it would be to park. (For the record, the parking lot is mall sized.) By the time the afternoon was upon us, I knew the order of the songs, the name of the harpist and the curriculum vitae of the soloists.This time, the program included my mom and was six pages shorter than it had been the year before, a blessing for restless grandchildren. As the choir filed up the aisle, my mom gave me a little wave. She wore a new robe \u2014 blue, flowing, majestic \u2014 prompting one of my kids to ask, \u201cWhy is Marmee wearing a nightgown?\u201d There was no misery this time, just candles and wind instruments and a sublime rendition of \u201cAway in a Manger\u201d from the children\u2019s choir. When I scanned the church, I spotted several of my parents\u2019 old friends. How had I missed them the year before?Later, as we placed ornaments on the tree, my mom said, \u201cWell, it looks like we made it.\u201dWe had.I realized \u2014 as I would hundreds of times over the next two decades \u2014 that this was not my second act, it was my mom\u2019s. She didn\u2019t want my script; she had her own libretto. She will never move to the beach or to a cozy studio near Lincoln Center. She won\u2019t get a microwave, a flat screen television or even the internet. She won\u2019t sign up for Match.com.My mom has her cats, her music and her grandchildren. We no longer need a babysitter, but we\u2019re grateful for all the years she showed up with homemade meatballs. She watched every episode of \u201cPhineas and Ferb\u201d and \u201cGood Luck Charlie.\u201d She drove my kids to swimming, dance and basketball, insisting on Mozart in the minivan. When they hit adolescence, she celebrated their independence, accepted their prickliness and embraced everything about them except their \u201cgodforsaken music.\u201dThis weekend, I\u2019ll go to my mom\u2019s 15th choir concert at Our Lady of Sorrows. Many of our other holiday traditions have fallen away thanks to lack of enthusiasm or cooperation \u2014 cards (the latter), Advent calendars (the former), Santa-shaped cookies (our two teenagers and one young adult prefer blondies baked after midnight in a cabal of TikTok and Taylor Swift). Surprisingly, I look forward to the concert more than any of the other December stalwarts, including Christmas morning.Now my mom\u2019s reminders arrive via text, a skill she learned as a gift for my 40th birthday. We don\u2019t pack coloring books or Goldfish, but we still count the pages in the program. My husband wonders why my mom hasn\u2019t been tapped for schola cantorum, the choir equivalent of varsity, and why she looks so serious (\u201cLike she\u2019s being led to the gulag\u201d) when she sings.The modern incarnation of the concert includes a live Nativity, with teenagers dressed as Mary and Joseph. Their appearance is unexpectedly moving, as if the pair is headed for a chilly stable in Bethlehem instead of a well-appointed altar in suburban New Jersey. I never miss an opportunity to remind my family that I played Joseph in the Christmas concert at my all-girls Catholic high school, but they\u2019re not interested. They\u2019re watching my mom. This is the one night of the year when all eyes are on her.After we drink hot chocolate in front of the rectory, and before we go back to my mom\u2019s house to trim the tree, I\u2019ll walk her to her car, known as Ruby. The air will be crisp. The lights on the hill will twinkle. A shooting star will turn out to be a plane landing nearby. The church and its environs are so unchanged, I could be a 9-year-old freshly sprung from class, walking to our old Buick, holding Mrs. Egan\u2019s hand. But I\u2019d rather be who I am now: a middle-aged woman lucky enough to be arm in arm with her mother.My mom will pause before she gets into Ruby. She\u2019ll say, \u201cWasn\u2019t it just beautiful?\u201dAnd I\u2019ll tell the truth, as I do every year, \u201cIt was the best.\u201d"}, {"slug_name": "15WELLNL-RECORDINGS-ONSITE", "section": "Well", "subsection": "Family", "title": "Recording a Family Member is a Gift to Your Future Self", "abstract": "You can create an audio time capsule with anyone you love.", "uri": "nyt://article/e33a53ea-e178-5596-90d0-8be6cf7a8150", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/15/well/family/family-audio-recording-holidays.html", "byline": "BY JANCEE DUNN", "thumbnail_standard": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/12/15/well/15WELL-NL-RECORDING-FAMILY/15WELL-NL-RECORDING-FAMILY-thumbStandard.jpg", "item_type": "Article", "source": "New York Times", "updated_date": "2022-12-15T20:05:06-05:00", "created_date": "2022-12-15T20:05:06-05:00", "published_date": "2022-12-15T20:05:06-05:00", "first_published_date": "2022-12-15T20:05:06-05:00", "material_type_facet": "News", "kicker": "", "subheadline": "", "des_facet": ["internal-sub-only-nl", "Memory", "Voice and Speech", "Death and Dying", "Gifts"], "org_facet": null, "per_facet": null, "geo_facet": null, "related_urls": null, "multimedia": [{"url": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/12/15/well/15WELL-NL-RECORDING-FAMILY/15WELL-NL-RECORDING-FAMILY-thumbStandard.jpg", "format": "Standard Thumbnail", "height": 75, "width": 75, "type": "image", "subtype": "photo", "caption": "", "copyright": "Illustration by Mike McQuade; Photographs by Getty Images"}, {"url": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/12/15/well/15WELL-NL-RECORDING-FAMILY/15WELL-NL-RECORDING-FAMILY-mediumThreeByTwo210.jpg", "format": "mediumThreeByTwo210", "height": 140, "width": 210, "type": "image", "subtype": "photo", "caption": "", "copyright": "Illustration by Mike McQuade; Photographs by Getty Images"}, {"url": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/12/15/well/15WELL-NL-RECORDING-FAMILY/15WELL-NL-RECORDING-FAMILY-mediumThreeByTwo440.jpg", "format": "mediumThreeByTwo440", "height": 293, "width": 440, "type": "image", "subtype": "photo", "caption": "", "copyright": "Illustration by Mike McQuade; Photographs by Getty Images"}, {"url": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/12/15/well/15WELL-NL-RECORDING-FAMILY/15WELL-NL-RECORDING-FAMILY-articleInline.jpg", "format": "Normal", "height": 127, "width": 190, "type": "image", "subtype": "photo", "caption": "", "copyright": "Illustration by Mike McQuade; Photographs by Getty Images"}], "body": "Every year at Christmas, my father has a ritual. He pours a large tumbler of Scotch, goes into his bedroom, shuts the door and listens to tapes I made of conversations with my grandma before she died 22 years ago. Back when her death was still raw, he would listen and cry. \u201cNow I\u2019m at the point where I hear her voice and just feel close to her again,\u201d Dad told me.When I was a young staff writer at Rolling Stone, I would sometimes get weary of trying to be hip. To center myself, I\u2019d call my grandma, whom we called \u201cMa.\u201d She lived in Sun City, Ariz., and we\u2019d have a nice, soothing conversation about the hummingbirds that visited her feeder or her latest trip to get her hair \u201cfixed\u201d at the beauty parlor.In that pre-cellphone era, I had a tape recorder attached to my phone for interviews. One day, when I remembered my dad telling me that he longed to hear his late father\u2019s voice but had no recording of it, I asked my grandma if I could tape our chat. She said she would be delighted to do it. My dad keeps the three half-hour tapes that I made in a safety deposit box at the bank, and gets them out each December.So, this season, I have a suggestion for you \u2014 consider recording an older relative for posterity. It doesn\u2019t matter how you do it. If you have a smartphone at a family gathering, you can use the voice memo app. If your relative lives elsewhere, Zoom has a recording option.When we record a conversation with a loved one, said Robert Neimeyer, director of the Portland Institute for Loss and Transition in Oregon, \u201cit\u2019s a gift that keeps on giving, because we extend their life beyond their literal physical presence. We still have access to them.\u201dResearch has demonstrated that voices can be as distinct as fingerprints, said Laura K. Guerrero, director of engagement and innovation at the Hugh Downs School of Human Communication at Arizona State University. A 2021 study published in Scientific Reports found that the sound of a mother\u2019s voice can decrease pain and increase levels of oxytocin, the bonding hormone; an empathetic phone call, according to a 2021 study published in JAMA Psychiatry, can reduce anxiety and depression.Anderson Cooper, the CNN anchor, is the host of a new podcast All There Is With Anderson Cooper, which is a thoughtful exploration of loss (his father died at 50 while undergoing heart surgery in 1978; he lost his brother Carter to suicide ten years later and his mother, Gloria Vanderbilt, died in 2019). In one episode, Cooper recounts how a few years ago, a radio interviewer sent him a link to a segment he had done with Cooper\u2019s father Wyatt. It was the first time that Cooper had heard his dad\u2019s voice since he was 10.Cooper didn\u2019t mention how this event made him feel so I phoned him to ask. \u201cIt was extraordinary to hear,\u201d he said. \u201cSuddenly my dad\u2019s voice filled my office. It\u2019s hard to explain the power of hearing somebody\u2019s voice. Obviously, I cried.\u201dWhat made it even more impactful, Cooper added, \u201cis that he was being interviewed about a book he had written, and he was actually talking about my brother and me, and what he hoped for us.\u201d He paused. \u201cIt was like suddenly a portal opened, and he was alive and talking about my brother and me in the present tense. To hear him saying my name and my brother\u2019s name \u2026\u201dCooper\u2019s voice broke. \u201cExcuse me. Sorry.\u201d He began to cry. \u201cIt took me back into this lost world. I\u2019m the last one left from that nuclear family, and I\u2019m the only one who remembers it. To have him speaking from that time is like evidence that it actually existed.\u201dIf you\u2019d like some reliable questions to get started, Dr. Neimeyer suggested those from a psychological intervention called Dignity Therapy. It was developed by Dr. Harvey Max Chochinov, professor of psychiatry at the University of Manitoba, to interview people at the end of their lives.They include: Tell me a little about your life history, particularly the parts that you think are the most important. When did you feel most alive? Are there specific things that you would want your family to know about you? What have you learned about life that you would like to pass along to others? What do you feel most proud of?I would add some questions I asked my grandma: When did you first feel like an adult? Tell me about a childhood friend who meant a lot to you. How did you meet Granddad?While questions that trigger memories are a reliable way to get people to open up, older relatives with cognitive impairment should be approached differently, said Laura N. Gitlin, dean of the College of Nursing and Health Professions at Drexel University.\u201cOne thing you don\u2019t want to do is keep saying, \u2018Do you remember when we went here or there?\u2019 Questions about memories can heighten anxiety and frustration, because it can sound like you\u2019re testing them,\u201d she said.You can also have family members take turns interviewing an older relative. \u201cIt would be a great project just to have people record something around a circle at Christmas time, and then you have a vocal scrapbook,\u201d said Dr. Guerrero.An audio time capsule can be recorded with anyone you love. Lately I have begun to interview my parents. My current favorite question is the one I posed to my mom at Thanksgiving: What memory always makes you laugh?She told me that her demure, churchgoing Alabama mother loved to watch wrestling matches on TV starring the lavishly-pompadoured star Gorgeous George. \u201cMama would shut the drapes when Gorgeous George was on,\u201d said Mom, \u201cso the neighbors wouldn\u2019t see.\u201dWhen my mom, who has lived in the Northeast for many years, speaks about her Alabama childhood, her Southern accent comes right back \u2014 an endearing quirk that I will store away for the future, a part of her that I\u2019ll never lose.Especially at this time of year, your to-do list can seem to stretch to infinity.

And do you really need to stretch before and after every exercise? \u201cThe simplest way to answer that question would be no,\u201d said Dr. Samantha Smith, an assistant professor of clinical orthopedics and rehabilitation at the Yale School of Medicine.But the longer answer, experts say, is that it depends on the type of workout you\u2019re doing as well as your fitness goals. Here\u2019s why.If you\u2019re about to do an exercise that doesn\u2019t involve a large range of motion, such as a jog for a few miles at a relatively steady pace, you don\u2019t need to stretch beforehand, said David Behm, a research professor in sports science at Memorial University of Newfoundland in Canada. (There are many different types of stretching, but for this story, we\u2019re talking about static stretching, where you hold still in a position to lengthen a muscle.)In such a case, a simple warm-up with dynamic movements \u2014 like lunges, squats, butt-kicks and high knees \u2014 will adequately prepare your body.While some evidence is conflicting, the majority of research also suggests that static stretching has no effect on \u2014 or may even hinder \u2014 your performance during strength and power training. (Power training involves performing moves like jumps or explosive lifts to work on both speed and strength.)Dr. Behm said that strength exercises involving large movements, like squats or bench presses, will lengthen muscles in the same way that stretching does. So stretching before a lifting session would not improve your performance (or be a great use of your time). And, Dr. Behm said, stretching can slightly fatigue your muscles and tendons, so if you stretch your quads and glutes before you do squats, for example, that may actually hinder your workout.Many people stretch before working out to reduce their risk of injury, but there\u2019s a lot of conflicting evidence on that topic as well, Dr. Behm said. For instance, he and his colleagues found in a 2021 review that while static stretching before exercise didn\u2019t always decrease the risk of injury, it did reduce muscle and tendon injuries when done before exercises requiring agility and explosive movements, like sprinting, jumping or pivoting.Ideal preparation for exercise comes in two steps, said Eduardo De Souza, an associate professor of health sciences and human performance at the University of Tampa. First, you should raise your body temperature with a warm-up \u2014 light jogging, jump rope or light cycling, for example. \u201cAnd then you do a rehearsal of the movements for what comes next.\u201dThat means dynamic movements that stretch your muscles\u2019 full range of motion \u2014 think walking lunges or arm circles.Many people stretch after a workout because they think it will aid their recovery and minimize soreness, Dr. Behm said. But \u201cthe literature is very mixed on that\u201d too, Dr. Smith added. When it comes to stretching after lifting weights to prevent muscle soreness, for example, \u201cthere have been studies that have shown a positive benefit and studies that have shown no benefit,\u201d she said. Likewise, in a 2021 review, researchers found no evidence that static stretching after a workout sped recovery (or did anything useful at all). That said, Dr. Smith hasn\u2019t seen any evidence that stretching as part of a cool down after a workout is harmful.In another 2021 review, Dr. Behm and his team found that stretching to minimize soreness only works if you have a consistent stretching routine, separate from other workouts, that you did regularly before you started doing strenuous exercise. These stretches should last for 30 to 60 seconds for each muscle group, and be performed at least twice a week.After a workout you should do a proper cool-down, and stretching is one way to do that, Dr. De Souza said \u2014 as is foam rolling or walking. Though, he added, there\u2019s not enough research to determine what cool-down method will make you feel the best after a workout.If you\u2019d like to improve your flexibility or mobility, then stretching various muscle groups for about 30 to 60 seconds each day can help with that, Dr. Smith said. It can also be beneficial in ways you may have never even realized.People don\u2019t often think of stretching for flexibility as its own kind of exercise or workout, Dr. Smith said, but making a point to add a separate stretching routine to your weekly workout regimen can help you reach your flexibility goals.Stretching can also help loosen tight muscles. But be careful, Dr. Smith said, since \u201can injured muscle or a weak muscle is frequently a tight muscle.\u201d If a muscle feels tight and painful, that\u2019s a sign that it could be injured, so you should see a health care provider before you start stretching it.Other benefits of regular stretching include improved balance as well as help with joint and muscle pain, Dr. Behm said.But rather than focusing on whether or not to stretch, Dr. Smith said, it\u2019s important to look at the bigger picture of physical fitness, \u201cwhich is that being strong, having good balance, having good coordination\u201d are all important goals to strive for with various types of exercise. Stretching can be a part of that, but if it doesn\u2019t fit in with your schedule or goals, you don\u2019t have to force it."}, {"slug_name": "14WELL-AORTIC-ANEURYSM", "section": "Well", "subsection": "Live", "title": "What is an Aortic Aneurysm?", "abstract": "They are more common than people may think.

He was just 49 years old and was reportedly in good health. His family announced on Wednesday that Mr. Wahl had a burst blood vessel leading from his heart, and that his death resulted from an aneurysm that ruptured.Aortic aneurysms are rare, doctors said, but more common than people may think. Between 1 to 2 percent of the U.S. population is prone to developing them, said Dr. Eric Roselli, a cardiovascular surgeon at the Cleveland Clinic. \u201cA lot of people don\u2019t know anything about it,\u201d Dr. Roselli added. \u201cThe aorta has been underappreciated.\u201dHere\u2019s what to know about the condition, the risk factors and the treatment options.Aneurysms, which are enlarged, weakened areas in blood vessels, can occur in any part of the body. An aortic aneurysm is a bulge in the aorta, the main blood vessel that ferries blood from the heart throughout the chest and the rest of the body.There are two primary types of aortic aneurysms: thoracic aortic aneurysms, which occur in the chest, and abdominal aortic aneurysms, which occur in the belly. Doctors tend to think of abdominal aortic aneurysms as a disease that occurs in older people, said Dr. Douglas Johnston, the chief of cardiac surgery for Northwestern Medicine, but thoracic aortic aneurysms can strike younger patients, too. Mr. Wahl had an ascending thoracic aortic aneurysm, according to the autopsy report.Two main issues can arise from an aortic aneurysm: a hole can form in the dilated aorta, letting blood burst into the body, or the blood that is pumping vigorously through the artery can tear the inner layers of the aorta. The tear in the layers of the aorta is known as a dissection and, when blood builds up and continues to tear the artery wall, it can lead to death.Aortic aneurysms are a major cause of unexpected death in otherwise healthy people, said Dr. James Pirruccello, an assistant professor of medicine and a cardiovascular researcher at the University of California, San Francisco.Many people with an enlarged aorta will not experience these complications, said Dr. Pirruccello. The risk of a dissection or a rupture increases as the aorta enlarges, he added. In some cases, depending on the size of the aneurysm, even patients without symptoms can have surgery to replace the segment of the aorta that is too large.People with high blood pressure or high cholesterol, both of which are typically tested for at regular physicals, are more likely to develop the condition, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Hardened arteries are also a risk factor.Having a bicuspid aortic valve, meaning that your aortic valve has two flaps, instead of three, puts you at a higher risk of developing an aortic aneurysm. Roughly 2 percent of the population has a bicuspid aortic valve, Dr. Johnston said.Smoking is a huge risk factor for abdominal aortic aneurysms. According to the C.D.C., a history of smoking accounts for roughly 75 percent of all abdominal aortic aneurysms.Men can also be at higher risk for abdominal aortic aneurysms, said Dr. Eric Isselbacher, an associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force has recommended that men between the ages of 65 and 75 who have ever smoked undergo an ultrasound screening.Genetics also play a role, and this makes it critical to know your family health history. If you have a direct family member (a sibling or a parent) who has or had an enlarged aorta, you should talk to your primary care doctor about getting screened, as the condition can run in families. Some inherited disorders, like Marfan syndrome and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, may increase a person\u2019s chances of developing an aortic aneurysm. It\u2019s crucial to know if a family member died suddenly and unexpectedly, as an aortic aneurysm could be a potential cause.Abdominal aortic aneurysms can be detected in a physical exam, said Dr. Isselbacher \u2014 physicians can feel enlarged aortas by pushing on the abdomen.But the average patient walking around with an aortic aneurysm in the chest will not have any symptoms. Dr. Johnston noted that some people may feel chest tightness or have a cough. Others may have a slight heart murmur, he added. CT scans and M.R.I.s can detect thoracic aortic aneurysms, but doctors generally do not recommend them unless you have a family history or other genetic risk for an enlarged aorta. An echocardiogram, or ultrasound of the heart, can also help detect aortic aneurysms.People with aortic ruptures or dissections may struggle to breathe or swallow and may feel severe chest pain radiating to the back, said Dr. Elizabeth Ratchford, the director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Vascular Medicine.\u201cAnyone who develops sudden chest pain should be in the hospital as soon as possible,\u201d Dr. Johnston said.If a patient has access to emergency care and is properly diagnosed, there is a high chance of survival. Doctors can perform surgery to remove the enlarged part of the aorta and help the patient recover.Once doctors detect an aneurysm, they monitor patients closely, typically taking imaging every six months, Dr. Pirruccello said. \u201cIt\u2019s not like we find it once and hope it doesn\u2019t grow,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re aggressive about following it,\u201d he added. \u201cIf the aneurysm reaches a critical size, a doctor may perform a surgery to replace the segment of the aorta that is too large.\u201dBut for some patients, it doesn\u2019t get to that point. \u201cMany people just get monitored and never have to have anything done about it,\u201d Dr. Ratchford said.To help prevent developing an aortic aneurysm, people should be mindful of managing their blood pressure. The basic building blocks of cardiovascular health \u2014 diet, exercise, sleep \u2014 are critical tools to reduce the risk of developing, or dying from, an aortic aneurysm.\u201cAn aneurysm is not a death sentence,\u201d Dr. Johnston said. If it is properly managed, \u201cpeople have a normal lifestyle and a normal life expectancy,\u201d he explained."}, {"slug_name": "14WELL-HANGOVER-WAR", "section": "Well", "subsection": "Live", "title": "Can Anything Help a Hangover?", "abstract": "Products claiming to ward off that morning-after agony are flooding the market.

But it hasn\u2019t stopped them from trying. Today, there is a growing assortment of products \u2014 from rebranded age-old remedies to new, specialized formulations \u2014 that claim to ease the morning-after symptoms. Alka Seltzer sells fizzing orange tablets designed for \u201changover relief.\u201d More Labs\u2019s \u201choliday drinking hack\u201d is to consume their liquid electrolyte supplement at night, so you \u201cnever ruin your morning plans.\u201d You can even buy vitamin B1 patches to slap onto your skin or pills that blend aspirin and caffeine that promise to \u201csolve\u201d brutal hangovers in just 15 minutes.According to Grand View Research, a market research firm, the hangover cure product category is expected to expand by 14.6 percent each year from 2021 to 2028. The growth \u201ccoincides with this deeper interest in our personal biology,\u201d and personal biology hacks, said Emily Moquin, a food and beverage analyst at Morning Consult, a research firm. Hangover cure products \u2014 and their buzzy ingredients \u2014 lean into people\u2019s desire to harness science and technology to ease their pain. \u201cPeople are saying, \u2018Even if I\u2019m going to have a glass or two of wine, I don\u2019t want to feel the effect at all,\u2019\u201d she said.Ms. Moquin believes the popularity of hangover products is also part of a larger optimization trend. \u201cIt ties into the cultural zeitgeist of productivity,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople feel like they can\u2019t afford to have an off day.\u201dDespite the proliferation of hangover cures, many researchers remain skeptical of their claims. \u201cThere\u2019s not a huge amount of evidence out there for really anything like a drug to prevent or cure a hangover at the moment,\u201d said Emmert Roberts, a fellow at Stanford University who recently reviewed 21 studies on hangover interventions. Dr. Roberts looked at compounds, such as tolfenamic acid, Korean pear juice and a vitamin B6 analog called pyritinol, available in products and rumored to alleviate hangover symptoms. He found scant evidence that they were actually effective.What\u2019s more, he said, most research into hangover treatments is of very poor quality; studies tend to involve small sample sizes. \u201cThere are a lot of snake oil salesmen peddling products that just don\u2019t pass muster,\u201d he said.\u201cIt\u2019s not what people want to hear,\u201d he added. \u201cBut there are things you can do.\u201dHere\u2019s what contributes to that wretched feeling after a big night out and some science-backed advice for how to lessen the misery.A hangover is the byproduct of acute alcohol withdrawal. As your body processes alcohol, it breaks it down into acetaldehyde, a colorless chemical compound, said Alexis Supan, a nutrition expert at the Cleveland Clinic. Acetaldehyde is essentially a poison, Ms. Supan said, and as your body struggles to metabolize it, your heart rate rises and you can become nauseous. In addition, alcohol works as a diuretic, occasionally inducing some of the most-dreaded hallmarks of a hangover: sweating, diarrhea, vomiting. Those, in turn, dehydrate your body even further and can cause a pounding headache.The standard advice for avoiding or lessening the severity of a hangover is still the best: Drink in moderation, alternate alcoholic drinks with water and try not to drink on an empty stomach.Your choice of alcoholic beverages also matters. Stick with clear, light-colored options like light beer and white wine, Ms. Supan said. Darker alcoholic drinks, like bourbon, rum, whiskey and red wine, can cause worse hangovers. This is because the fermentation process that darkens them also releases compounds called congeners, which can intensify how poor you feel as your body works to break them down. Sugary cocktails, along with mixers like cranberry juice and sodas, can also contribute to a bad morning, Ms. Supan said. They initially elevate your blood sugar levels, and then, as those levels drop, you feel fatigued and weak.When you get home, taking aspirin before you go to bed isn\u2019t likely to ward off a hangover altogether, said Dr. Holly Stankewicz, an emergency medicine physician at St. Luke\u2019s University Health Network in Pennsylvania, who has researched hangover prevention. But a pain reliever may be able to lessen aches when you wake up.Hydration is just as important the next day, to help ease a headache and replenish fluids. For most people, simply drinking water or seltzer will be enough; a good practice is to drink fluids until your urine is pale yellow, Ms. Supan said. But if you\u2019re throwing up the morning after, or if you sweat a lot the night before because you were out dancing or in a packed bar, Ms. Supan said, you should probably reach for an electrolyte replacement, like Gatorade or Pedialyte.True to conventional wisdom, caffeine can help you burst through the fog and grogginess that come with a hangover, Ms. Supan said. A cup of coffee might be just as effective as the caffeine included in some hangover pills.As for all those recovery drinks and hangover prevention patches, many are essentially vitamin cocktails: A review of 82 hangover products found that 51 contained one or more vitamins that exceeded the daily recommended dose. It\u2019s important to replenish vitamins after drinking, but it\u2019s better to get them from natural food sources, Ms. Supan said. In fact, some of the comfort foods you often crave after a night out are a good choice: A classic diner meal with eggs, home fries, cheese and a bit of ham would supply vitamins B, C and zinc, Ms. Supan advised. \u201cWe lose a lot of those things when we\u2019re drinking. We want to try to bump them up the following day.\u201dStill, if you find yourself weary and reeling the morning after a party, or dreading the coming headache before you go out, shelling out for a hangover healer isn\u2019t likely to do you much harm, experts said. But \u201cjust taking a pill probably isn\u2019t going to be enough,\u201d Dr. Stankewicz said. \u201cTime is really the only thing that will make it better.\u201d"}, {"slug_name": "13WELL-FLU-RSV-COVID", "section": "Well", "subsection": "", "title": "Do You Have Covid, Flu or R.S.V.?", "abstract": "If you\u2019re feeling sick, this handy chart will help you zero in on which virus you might have.", "uri": "nyt://article/db084840-be7c-5baf-ab57-81cadaa6ae40", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/13/well/covid-flu-rsv-symptoms.html", "byline": "BY KNVUL SHEIKH", "thumbnail_standard": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/12/13/well/13WELL-FLU-RSV-COVID1/13WELL-FLU-RSV-COVID1-thumbStandard.jpg", "item_type": "Article", "source": "New York Times", "updated_date": "2022-12-13T13:44:18-05:00", "created_date": "2022-12-13T13:44:18-05:00", "published_date": "2022-12-13T13:44:18-05:00", "first_published_date": "2022-12-13T13:44:18-05:00", "material_type_facet": "News", "kicker": "", "subheadline": "", "des_facet": ["Coronavirus (2019-nCoV)", "Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV)", "Influenza", "Content Type: Service", "Children and Childhood", "Viruses", "Fever", "Disease Rates"], "org_facet": null, "per_facet": null, "geo_facet": null, "related_urls": null, "multimedia": [{"url": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/12/13/well/13WELL-FLU-RSV-COVID1/13WELL-FLU-RSV-COVID1-thumbStandard.jpg", "format": "Standard Thumbnail", "height": 75, "width": 75, "type": "image", "subtype": "photo", "caption": "", "copyright": "Getty Images"}, {"url": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/12/13/well/13WELL-FLU-RSV-COVID1/13WELL-FLU-RSV-COVID1-mediumThreeByTwo210.jpg", "format": "mediumThreeByTwo210", "height": 140, "width": 210, "type": "image", "subtype": "photo", "caption": "", "copyright": "Getty Images"}, {"url": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/12/13/well/13WELL-FLU-RSV-COVID1/13WELL-FLU-RSV-COVID1-mediumThreeByTwo440.jpg", "format": "mediumThreeByTwo440", "height": 293, "width": 440, "type": "image", "subtype": "photo", "caption": "", "copyright": "Getty Images"}, {"url": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/12/13/well/13WELL-FLU-RSV-COVID1/13WELL-FLU-RSV-COVID1-articleInline.jpg", "format": "Normal", "height": 127, "width": 190, "type": "image", "subtype": "photo", "caption": "", "copyright": "Getty Images"}], "body": "Three different viruses are sending children and adults to hospital emergency rooms across the United States this winter.

As a result, more people are vulnerable to common winter viruses now that much of the country has set aside masks and social distance and is traveling and gathering indoors more.To make matters worse, we may also be more susceptible to severe illness if we do fall ill, said Dr. Priya Soni, a pediatric infectious disease specialist at Cedars-Sinai Guerin Children\u2019s in Los Angeles.\u201cYou can get really sick, perhaps more so than you would have normally because your immune system really hasn\u2019t been challenged as much recently,\u201d she said.Here\u2019s a guide to spotting symptoms \u2014 and what to do to confirm and treat the various infections.Mark your symptoms below and then sort by selecting an illness.The flu, Covid and R.S.V. have symptoms that overlap \u2014 and also can look quite similar to those of the common cold, which is caused by a variety of viruses. You can develop a cough, fever, headache or runny or stuffy nose with any respiratory virus, said Dr. Michael Chang, an infectious disease specialist at Memorial Hermann Health System in Houston. But one way to differentiate among viral infections is to monitor how quickly your symptoms ramp up.Symptoms of the flu come on quickly \u2014 often just one day after exposure to someone who was sick \u2014 and can be felt all over the body. People with the flu often describe feeling like they\u2019ve been hit by a truck, Dr. Chang said. With colds, symptoms may take two or three days to appear and are much milder. Covid and R.S.V. have even longer incubation periods. It can take an average of five days from exposure to the coronavirus to the development of early Covid-19 symptoms, though newer variants may result in an active infection as soon as three days after exposure. R.S.V. takes about four to six days. With Covid and R.S.V., symptoms also build slowly: You may start out feeling sniffly, and then develop a cough or a headache the next day and a fever the next.Adults afflicted with the flu are likely to experience very high fevers, up to 103 or 104 degrees, Dr. Chang said. But fevers rarely accompany colds, particularly in adults. And those with Covid-19 and R.S.V. experience mild fevers or none at all. \u201cEspecially with the newer variants and people having been exposed through immunization or if they\u2019ve had an infection before, we\u2019re seeing that more patients are now only mildly symptomatic, and they only have low-grade fevers, around 99 or 100,\u201d Dr. Chang said.Other, less common symptoms can also help you differentiate between illnesses. For example, the flu and Covid-19 can cause diarrhea and vomiting; these gastrointestinal issues are more likely in young children. Covid-19 can also result in a sudden and severe loss of taste or smell, which is very different from the temporary dampening of these senses when you have a stuffy nose with a cold or flu, Dr. Chang said.People with R.S.V. are less likely to feel the full-body fatigue and muscle aches that come with the flu or Covid-19. Instead, R.S.V. is often accompanied by a very wet and forceful cough. \u201cOf the three viruses, R.S.V. will tend to have the most mucus in your nose and throat and the most congestion,\u201d Dr. Chang said.Another distinctive symptom of R.S.V. is wheezing, particularly in young children. You can hear it as a high-pitched whistling or crackling sound when a sick child exhales. And it may be accompanied by faster or more labored breathing overall.Looking at community transmission rates in your area is another way to narrow the possibilities for which virus you might have. While official Covid case numbers may be undercounted because of increased home testing, you can still check the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s Covid-19 map, in addition to relying on local news and social networks for a sense of whether members of your community are sick.Flu and R.S.V. tests have to be conducted in doctor\u2019s offices or clinical laboratories and may be more accurate representations of case rates across the country. The C.D.C. publishes this data in weekly flu maps and R.S.V. trends.In general, adults over 65 are at highest risk for all three viruses. That\u2019s because the body\u2019s ability to fight off viruses naturally decreases with age. And older adults are more likely to have medical conditions that can put them at risk for severe symptoms and complications if they get sick.Young children also tend to experience more severe symptoms of the flu and R.S.V. because their immune systems don\u2019t yet know how to fight off pathogens properly, Dr. Soni said. Infants and toddlers also have smaller airways that tend to become congested easily, making their illness more likely to progress from mild to severe and cause difficulty breathing.Children are more likely to experience asymptomatic or mild Covid-19 infections compared with adults, Dr. Chang said, though \u201cit\u2019s not really well understood why that is.\u201dThe only way to definitively diagnose or rule out one of these viruses is to get tested. While you can easily check for Covid-19 at home, there are no rapid home tests for the flu or R.S.V. There is a combined P.C.R. test developed by Labcorp that allows you to take a nasal swab for Covid-19, flu and R.S.V. and mail the sample to a lab. But results take one or two days.Most clinics, urgent care centers and hospitals also have combination tests for all three viruses, Dr. Chang said. But some doctors may forgo a diagnostic P.C.R. if you have a mild infection. That\u2019s because the symptom management for most people will stay the same regardless of which respiratory virus they have, Dr. Soni said. (Those who fall in high-risk categories or are sick enough to be hospitalized may receive antiviral treatment for their infection, such as Paxlovid for Covid-19, Tamiflu for the flu and ribavirin for R.S.V.)\u201cThe best things most people can do are stay hydrated with lots and lots of fluids, keep a humidifier running in the room and help younger kids with nasal suctioning devices,\u201d Dr. Soni said. Children and adults who are generally healthy and do not have other underlying medical conditions, she added, can try over-the-counter medicines for symptom relief and will typically recover with a little bit of time."}, {"slug_name": "13WELL-MASKS-TRIPLEDEMIC", "section": "Well", "subsection": "", "title": "It\u2019s Time to Wear a Mask Again, Health Experts Say", "abstract": "A high-quality, well-fitting mask is your best protection against infection from the coronavirus, influenza and R.S.V.", "uri": "nyt://article/ce078aa4-5120-54d2-81c9-b1b43173bc75", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/13/well/covid-flu-rsv-masks-tripledemic.html", "byline": "BY DANA G.

A \u201ctripledemic\u201d of the coronavirus, influenza and respiratory syncytial virus, known as R.S.V., sweeping through the United States has prompted several cities and counties, including New York City and Los Angeles County, to encourage people to wear a mask in indoor public spaces once again.Nationwide, Covid-19 case rates and hospitalizations have spiked by 56 percent and 24 percent, respectively, over the past two weeks. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that there have already been 13 million illnesses and 7,300 deaths from flu this season, and those numbers are expected to rise in the coming months. (Over the past decade, annual flu deaths have ranged from 12,000 to 52,000 people, with the peak in January and February.) And while R.S.V. finally appears to be on the decline, infection rates are still high across much of the country.The C.D.C. officially advises wearing a mask on a county-by-county basis depending on community Covid-19 levels, which take into account virus-related hospital admissions, bed capacity and case rates. However, in an interview with NPR last week, Dr. Rochelle Walensky, the C.D.C. director, said, \u201cYou don\u2019t need to wait for C.D.C.\u2019s recommendation, certainly, to wear a mask.\u201dRates of Covid-19, flu and R.S.V. \u201cmay be more intense or a little bit less intense in some parts of the country, but really, the entire country is being affected,\u201d said Dr. William Schaffner, a professor of preventive medicine at the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine. As a result, he urged anyone who lives in a high-risk household to \u201cput your mask back on\u201d when in public spaces. High-risk households would include those with adults over the age of 65, pregnant women, people with a pre-existing condition such as heart disease, diabetes or lung disease and anyone who is immune-compromised.Dr. Helen Chu, an associate professor of allergy and infectious diseases at UW Medicine in Seattle, went a step further, recommending everyone mask while infection and hospitalization rates are so high. \u201cI think it\u2019s a good time to mask,\u201d she said. \u201cGiven where we are right now with hospitals being at very close to capacity, especially in pediatric hospitals with R.S.V. and with flu, I think that anything that you can do to slow down community transmission is going to be helpful.\u201dThere is strong evidence that masks help to reduce the transmission of several respiratory viruses. One paper published in 2020 by researchers in Hong Kong showed that people sick with either Covid-19 or the flu breathed out fewer viral particles when they were wearing a surgical mask. (Masks were found not to be as effective for the rhinovirus, though, which causes the common cold.) A study of Covid-19 policies in Boston-area schools found that removing a mask mandate in 2022 was tied to nearly 12,000 additional cases among students and staff.Rates of influenza and other respiratory viruses essentially flattened during the 2020 and 2021 winter seasons, which was largely attributed to the protections the country took to prevent the spread of Covid-19. \u201cWhat Covid has shown us, because we\u2019ve been social distancing and mask wearing, is that influenza, the common cold viruses, R.S.V. are suppressed remarkably\u201d by these small individual behaviors, Dr. Schaffner said.Masks work by filtering out both the tiny aerosol particles through which the coronavirus is primarily spread and the larger droplets that are thought to be responsible for most influenza and R.S.V. transmission. They also stop you from touching your face in case you picked up virus particles on your hands from a doorknob or subway pole. And while masks are most effective at stopping the spread of these viruses when the infected person is wearing one, masking to protect yourself from disease is still beneficial, particularly if you\u2019re using a high-quality version like N95, KN95 or KF94.\u201cThe basic truth is that masks work,\u201d said Syra Madad, senior director of the systemwide special pathogens program at New York City Health + Hospitals. \u201cWhether you\u2019re talking about Covid-19 or other respiratory viruses like R.S.V. and flu, wearing a mask will help protect you against all these respiratory viral illnesses.\u201dOther public health measures, such as hand washing, surface wiping and air filtration, are also important to limit the spread of respiratory viruses. Special emphasis has been placed on vaccination, especially by the White House and C.D.C., and you should absolutely get a flu shot and the latest Covid-19 booster if you haven\u2019t already. But vaccines are best thought of as protection against severe illness if you do get infected with a virus. Masks are the first line of defense against transmission.\u201cFrankly, to prevent transmission, neither antivirals nor vaccines have done a great job,\u201d said Dr. Abraar Karan, an infectious disease fellow and postdoctoral researcher at Stanford Medicine. \u201cWhat prevents transmission is actually masking and likely air filtration.\u201dWhen weighing when and where to mask, Dr. Madad recommended paying attention to the \u201cThree Cs\u201d: close contact, crowded spaces and confined places with poor ventilation. The experts urged wearing masks while traveling on planes and public transportation, and they strongly suggested doing it while out shopping for groceries and gifts. For smaller holiday parties with people you know, it\u2019s fine to forgo masks if guests test beforehand and stay home if they\u2019re feeling rundown.Realistically, not everyone in the United States \u2014 or a certain city \u2014 will wear a mask. In fact, you might find yourself the only person in a store or on a plane who\u2019s wearing one. Don\u2019t let that discourage you. For one thing, remember that no one is thinking about you as much as you think they are. In social psychology, this is called the spotlight illusion, said Gretchen Chapman, a professor of social and decision sciences at Carnegie Mellon University. \u201cI may feel that everyone\u2019s staring at me because I\u2019m wearing a mask, but chances are that\u2019s like the 11th thing on their list to worry about,\u201d she said.What\u2019s more, Dr. Chapman said, \u201cThere are lots of situations in life where we do something that makes us feel awkward, but if we think it\u2019s important enough, we do it anyway.\u201d"}, {"slug_name": "24covid-ongoing-paxlovid-rebound", "section": "Well", "subsection": "Live", "title": "What should I watch out for if I\u2019m worried about Paxlovid rebound?", "abstract": "Some people who had taken the antiviral medication experienced a recurrence of Covid symptoms after their infection appeared to have cleared up.", "uri": "nyt://article/1b4678c8-6d56-5db8-a6f3-c988361bacbc", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/13/well/live/paxlovid-rebound.html", "byline": "BY DANI BLUM", "thumbnail_standard": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/12/24/multimedia/24covid-ongoing-paxlovid-rebound1-1-a6c8/24covid-ongoing-paxlovid-rebound1-1-a6c8-thumbStandard.jpg", "item_type": "Article", "source": "New York Times", "updated_date": "2022-12-15T09:02:42-05:00", "created_date": "2022-12-13T12:57:20-05:00", "published_date": "2022-12-13T12:57:20-05:00", "first_published_date": "2022-12-13T12:57:20-05:00", "material_type_facet": "News", "kicker": "", "subheadline": "", "des_facet": ["Paxlovid (Drug)", "Coronavirus (2019-nCoV)"], "org_facet": null, "per_facet": null, "geo_facet": null, "related_urls": null, "multimedia": [{"url": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/12/24/multimedia/24covid-ongoing-paxlovid-rebound1-1-a6c8/24covid-ongoing-paxlovid-rebound1-1-a6c8-thumbStandard.jpg", "format": "Standard Thumbnail", "height": 75, "width": 75, "type": "image", "subtype": "photo", "caption": "", "copyright": "Wolfgang Rattay/Reuters"}, {"url": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/12/24/multimedia/24covid-ongoing-paxlovid-rebound1-1-a6c8/24covid-ongoing-paxlovid-rebound1-1-a6c8-mediumThreeByTwo210.jpg", "format": "mediumThreeByTwo210", "height": 140, "width": 210, "type": "image", "subtype": "photo", "caption": "", "copyright": "Wolfgang Rattay/Reuters"}, {"url": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/12/24/multimedia/24covid-ongoing-paxlovid-rebound1-1-a6c8/24covid-ongoing-paxlovid-rebound1-1-a6c8-mediumThreeByTwo440.jpg", "format": "mediumThreeByTwo440", "height": 293, "width": 440, "type": "image", "subtype": "photo", "caption": "", "copyright": "Wolfgang Rattay/Reuters"}, {"url": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/12/24/multimedia/24covid-ongoing-paxlovid-rebound1-1-a6c8/24covid-ongoing-paxlovid-rebound1-1-a6c8-articleInline.jpg", "format": "Normal", "height": 122, "width": 190, "type": "image", "subtype": "photo", "caption": "", "copyright": "Wolfgang Rattay/Reuters"}], "body": "Reports of \u201cPaxlovid rebound\u201d popped up in the spring of 2022, as some people who had taken the antiviral medication experienced a recurrence of Covid symptoms, days after their infection appeared to have cleared up.

Fever is much more common in people who are unvaccinated, he added.If you have an unexplained sore throat, and then develop a fever and night sweats, \u201cit\u2019s much more likely to be Covid than your run of the mill cold,\u201d said Dr. Justin Fiala, a pulmonary and critical care specialist at Northwestern Medicine. BQ.1.1 and BQ.1 symptoms are more or less centered around and above the throat, Dr. Fiala said, as opposed to earlier versions of the virus, which affected the lungs."}, {"slug_name": "13ASKWELL-MAN-HAIRS", "section": "Well", "subsection": "Live", "title": "Why Do Men Sprout Hairs in Weird Places With Age?", "abstract": "Dangling nose hairs, spiky ear hairs \u2014 what gives?", "uri": "nyt://article/302e5fbf-ae9a-5c75-ab3b-334b516becb6", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/13/well/live/men-nose-ear-hair.html", "byline": "BY RACHEL RABKIN PEACHMAN", "thumbnail_standard": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/12/20/multimedia/13ASKWELL-MAN-HAIRS1-1-846b/13ASKWELL-MAN-HAIRS1-1-846b-thumbStandard-v2.jpg", "item_type": "Article", "source": "New York Times", "updated_date": "2022-12-13T05:00:19-05:00", "created_date": "2022-12-13T05:00:19-05:00", "published_date": "2022-12-13T05:00:19-05:00", "first_published_date": "2022-12-13T05:00:19-05:00", "material_type_facet": "News", "kicker": "Ask Well", "subheadline": "", "des_facet": ["Hair", "Content Type: Service", "Age, Chronological", "Skin", "Genetics and Heredity", "Men and Boys", "Hormones", "Testosterone", "Nose"], "org_facet": ["American Academy of Dermatology"], "per_facet": null, "geo_facet": null, "related_urls": null, "multimedia": [{"url": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/12/20/multimedia/13ASKWELL-MAN-HAIRS1-1-846b/13ASKWELL-MAN-HAIRS1-1-846b-thumbStandard-v2.jpg", "format": "Standard Thumbnail", "height": 75, "width": 75, "type": "image", "subtype": "photo", "caption": "", "copyright": "Joyce Lee for The New York Times"}, {"url": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/12/20/multimedia/13ASKWELL-MAN-HAIRS1-1-846b/13ASKWELL-MAN-HAIRS1-1-846b-mediumThreeByTwo210-v2.jpg", "format": "mediumThreeByTwo210", "height": 140, "width": 210, "type": "image", "subtype": "photo", "caption": "", "copyright": "Joyce Lee for The New York Times"}, {"url": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/12/20/multimedia/13ASKWELL-MAN-HAIRS1-1-846b/13ASKWELL-MAN-HAIRS1-1-846b-mediumThreeByTwo440-v2.jpg", "format": "mediumThreeByTwo440", "height": 293, "width": 440, "type": "image", "subtype": "photo", "caption": "", "copyright": "Joyce Lee for The New York Times"}, {"url": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/12/20/multimedia/13ASKWELL-MAN-HAIRS1-1-846b/13ASKWELL-MAN-HAIRS1-1-846b-articleInline.jpg", "format": "Normal", "height": 285, "width": 190, "type": "image", "subtype": "photo", "caption": "", "copyright": "Joyce Lee for The New York Times"}], "body": "Q: I\u2019m a man in my 50s and have noticed hair sprouting in weird places like the tops and insides of my ears and in my nose. Is this normal? Why does it happen? How can I get rid of it?It tends to start gradually. Maybe you spot a few long hairs dangling from your nostrils. Or perhaps your barber asks if you would like the mini thicket of hair sprouting from your earlobe trimmed along with your sideburns.However it begins, rest assured that this is a normal part of aging for many men. But why does it happen? The short answer is that hair growth later in life has a lot to do with testosterone and genetics. Still, that doesn\u2019t mean you have to live with it. If it bothers you, there are plenty of ways to nip it in the bud.Hormones come into the picture by influencing when and where hair grows on the body, what type it is and how long it grows. During puberty, for instance, androgens (sex hormones that are more abundant in men than in women) such as testosterone trigger hair follicles on the face, chest, underarms and pubic area to replace existing short, light hairs with thicker, darker hairs that grow for longer periods of time.As men age, typically as they enter their 40s, 50s and 60s, testosterone\u2019s effect on hair growth may start to become apparent in new, sometimes perplexing, ways.\u201cTestosterone primes or changes the hair bulb\u201d in certain susceptible areas, said Dr. Bradley Anawalt, an endocrinologist and professor of medicine at the University of Washington School of Medicine.Parts of your body that you may not even have realized have hair follicles, like the top of your nose or your earlobes, can become sensitive to the testosterone that has been building for years. This causes the hair there to become thicker and to grow longer, resulting in more noticeable, straggly hairs.These new, errant hairs \u201creflect the slow effects of testosterone over a lifetime on those little hair bulbs in those areas,\u201d Dr. Anawalt said. \u201cMany of these changes take years.\u201dGenes also play a role in this process. \u201cThere are genetic differences in responsiveness to testosterone in those areas, which is why some people get a thick, luxurious beard and some people don\u2019t,\u201d Dr. Anawalt said. In other words, if you come from a long line of men who grow full beards or long nose hairs, there\u2019s a good chance you or your son will inherit this feature as well.Paradoxically, testosterone can have the opposite effect on the scalp if you\u2019re genetically predisposed to baldness. In this case, testosterone inhibits hair growth in follicles on the head, causing scalp hairs to fall out and be replaced with short, fine, barely perceptible hairs.Another curiosity: Testosterone seems to have no effect on eyebrow length. The reason your eyebrows become bushier or thinner over the years is not entirely clear. It could be because of different hormones or other aspects of aging, Dr. Anawalt said.Scientists haven\u2019t agreed on a theory for whether there is an evolutionary \u200creason for age-related hair changes in men, said Dr. Steven Daveluy, an associate professor of dermatology at Wayne State University in Detroit. One hypothesis, he said, is that baldness or ear hair may have been seen as a sign of high testosterone and virility, making men with those characteristics appear to be viable mates. Whatever the possible benefit might have been, long nose hair doesn\u2019t seem to be serving the same purpose these days.For many men, the sudden appearance of extraneous hairs may be inconsequential. But if you decide you want to get rid of them, you have several options.Laser hair removal. For long-lasting results, laser hair removal can be done on sections of the body over several sessions. But it tends to work best on hair that is dark (not fair or gray) because the laser works by targeting the pigment in hair, Dr. Daveluy said. The light from the laser is absorbed as heat by the hair\u2019s pigment, which then damages the follicle, preventing it from growing hair. The more sessions you do, the greater your chances of stopping hair growth permanently. One downside: It can be painful or uncomfortable.Electrolysis. If you have light-colored hair, you may consider electrolysis, Dr. Daveluy said. During this procedure, a tiny needle is inserted into each hair follicle, where it emits an electrical current that destroys the follicle and stops it from growing hair. Like laser treatment, electrolysis can be painful and needs to be done over several sessions, particularly if you are hoping for permanent results. It also works on dark-colored hair.The American Academy of Dermatology recommends looking for a board-certified dermatologist for laser hair removal and either a board-certified dermatologist or a board-certified electrologist for electrolysis. Also be aware that both treatments can cause irritation and permanent skin discoloration.Nonpermanent strategies. Shorter-term solutions for hair removal include waxing, shaving, clipping, plucking and using hair-removal creams.\u201cJust make sure you follow the instructions on the creams because if you leave those on too long, they can damage the skin,\u201d Dr. Daveluy said. He also noted that plucking and waxing can be painful and cause skin irritation, so talk with your dermatologist if you run into problems."}, {"slug_name": "12WELL-TASK-PARALYSIS", "section": "Well", "subsection": "Mind", "title": "How to Save Yourself From \u2018Task Paralysis\u2019", "abstract": "Your brain can see your to-do list as a threat.

This sense of helplessness \u2014 also called \u201coverwhelm freeze\u201d \u2014 always seems to set in when you have a dozen things on your list, all equally pressing. Or it shows up when you have one huge thing to accomplish that really matters, and you\u2019re stumped on how to even begin.Instead of logically working through your list or slowly chipping away at that behemoth task, your brain acts like it\u2019s a rabbit that\u2019s just sensed a dog in the yard \u2014 it stops dead in its tracks.Ellen Hendriksen, a clinical assistant professor at Boston University\u2019s Center for Anxiety and Related Disorders, says the freeze response \u2014 of \u201cfight, flight or freeze\u201d fame \u2014 arises when we view the task (or many tasks) in front of us as a threat. \u201cOur bodies react to threat the same way, whether the threat is external, like the proverbial saber-toothed tiger, or the threat is internal,\u201d she said. \u201cWith a big overwhelming task list, that threat could be the threat of failure, or it could be the threat of letting others down. It could be the threat of feeling stupid or incompetent because we don\u2019t know where to start or how to do things.\u201dThis experience can happen to anyone, but people who struggle with perfectionism may be especially prone to it. \u201cIn perfectionism, we over-identify with our performance,\u201d Dr. Hendriksen said. \u201cIf we unconsciously think we are what we do, then what we have to do becomes much more fraught.\u201dIn the face of this anxiety, the brain\u2019s executive center loses control. Ordinarily, the prefrontal cortex, which is critical for planning, decision-making and self-regulation, keeps more emotional parts of the brain in check. But during times of stress, the balance shifts and regions like the amygdala, which is responsible for identifying threats, can start to take over.These expert tips can help you snap out of your frozen state and bring your control center back online.First, you need to turn down your stress levels a notch or two. Try taking a few deep breaths, which can lower your cortisol, one of the main stress hormones.If it\u2019s a single daunting task that\u2019s causing you to feel overwhelmed, the gold-standard advice is to break it into tiny steps. \u201cIt\u2019s like that old adage, \u2018How do you eat an elephant? One bite at a time,\u2019\u201d said Piers Steel, a professor of organizational behavior and human resources at the University of Calgary.These steps should be \u201cridiculously small,\u201d Dr. Hendriksen said. \u201cThe measuring stick is that your task should be so small that you feel no resistance.\u201dThe steps also need to be concrete, restricting you to a time, location and duration when you\u2019ll get a certain thing done. Dr. Steel recommended thinking about them as if you\u2019re giving \u201cinstructions to a teenager who doesn\u2019t really want to do it, so you have to be really specific.\u201dTake some of the pressure off, too, by telling yourself it\u2019s OK if you do a bad job. You can always come back and improve on it later. Think about the number of mistakes or do-overs you will allow yourself to make, Dr. Hendriksen said. \u201cThe answer cannot be zero.\u201dFinally, take a first step, any first step. \u201cIt\u2019s the idea of the task which is often stopping you from doing it,\u201d Dr. Steel said. \u201cIt\u2019s so big you don\u2019t know what to do, and since you can start anywhere, you start nowhere.\u201d Once you get going, the work tends to flow more easily and you often realize, \u201cOh, this isn\u2019t so bad.\u201dFor an overwhelming list of lots of little to-dos, the key is to start strategically. You could do the most important or timely thing first, of course, but another option is to begin with the most enjoyable task. \u201cWe\u2019re so focused on the should that we forget that sometimes in there is some want, and following that can be very refreshing,\u201d Dr. Hendriksen said. \u201cIf all this has to get done, then I might as well approach the one where I feel the least resistance.\u201dStarting with the smallest or easiest item can also build confidence and momentum. \u201cDo some part of it that you can do and that you can succeed at, because nothing builds success like success,\u201d said Joseph Ferrari, a professor of psychology at DePaul University.Another place to start is with what\u2019s most important to someone else. \u201cWhen you feel overwhelmed, you need to ask yourself, how does this make other people\u2019s lives easier?\u201d Dr. Ferrari said. \u201cIf I do this, will this help someone else? If I don\u2019t do this, am I delaying somebody else from doing what they need?\u201dIncentivizing yourself can also help break the ice with a long list or that one task you really don't want to do. If there\u2019s an email you need to send that you keep putting off (and off and off), promise yourself ten guilt-free minutes of internet celebrity gossip afterward. Or pair a pleasant task with an unpleasant one, like doing a crossword while you\u2019re on hold with your health insurance provider. \u201cYou use something you like to do to reward something you don\u2019t like to do,\u201d Dr. Ferrari said. \u201cThat has been around for 50 years and it\u2019s a very successful technique.\u201dIf it\u2019s simply impossible to get through your to-do list before everything is due, delegate. Ask a co-worker, family member or friend to take one of the items off your list, knowing that you\u2019ll return the favor in the future.Before you get started, remove distractions to help you focus on the tasks at hand. Put away your phone, clear your desk and set a timer for 30 minutes (or longer, but sometimes it\u2019s good to start small). Tell people \u2014 including yourself \u2014 that you can\u2019t be disturbed during that time. That includes no breaks for snacks, Slack or doing the dishes.What you really don\u2019t want is for your paralysis to turn into procrastination, where you do something small and pleasurable in the short-term, like scroll through Instagram, to avoid the big hard thing. Distraction and procrastination often go together, Dr. Steel said, because \u201cIf you have an environment where temptation is always nearby and easily available, you\u2019re going to procrastinate more.\u201dTask avoidance not only stalls you out in the moment, it sets you up to repeat the experience next time. When you avoid something that makes you anxious, what Dr. Hendriksen called \u201cthe two lies of anxiety\u201d get reinforced. The first lie is that the thing really was threatening, and the second lie is that you could not have handled it.\u201cWhen we avoid things, we underscore those two lies and never learn that, \u2018Oh, that wasn\u2019t as bad as I thought!\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cAnd, \u2018Look! I could handle that!\u2019\u201dThe key is to work through the anxiety and teach your brain that it can still function under stress. Doing so builds both confidence and good habits for the next time your to-do list looms."}, {"slug_name": "10WNT-WINTER-BIRD-WATCHING", "section": "Well", "subsection": "Move", "title": "The Surprising Health Benefits of Bird-Watching", "abstract": "Spending time outdoors with a pair of binoculars is good for your body and soul.

She was stuck in her house, struggling with chronic pain resulting from complications after a surgery. The pain had become so debilitating that Ms. Watts, formerly an avid biker and hiker, couldn\u2019t hold a pencil or pick up a cup at times. It had forced her to leave her job as a therapist and confined her to her home, where she had sunk into a deep depression.Then one day, she looked out her kitchen window.\u201cThere\u2019s a tree that has a branch that tends to grow down. And there was this bright yellow bird there,\u201d she said.She didn\u2019t know that it was called a yellow warbler, or really anything about birds at all, but she was entranced. Every day she watched it jump from branch to branch, barely discernible from the yellow blossoms of the tipu tree. And over time, this bird led her to others in her yard and brought Ms. Watts out of her pain and sadness and back into the world.She started keeping track of the birds she saw, joined a local Audubon Society chapter and traveled the state looking for new birds. She now sits on the Audubon California board of directors. In short, she said, birding changed her life.\u201cIt\u2019s contagious. It\u2019s addicting,\u201d said Ms. Watts, who is writing a book called \u201cKeep Looking Up: Your Guide to the Powerful Healing of Birdwatching.\u201d \u201cBirding really does cross over into so many areas of wellness, health and fitness.\u201dStarting on Dec. 14, bird-watchers across the country will begin the Audubon Christmas Bird Count, a 123-year-old tradition where people gather and help to catalog species in their area. Novices and serious birders alike walk through parks, forests and fields, looking for birds and listening for bird song; someone shouts \u201canother yellow one!\u201d and somebody else writes down \u201cgoldfinch.\u201dIf you are curious about bird-watching and looking for a reason to get outside this winter, now is the perfect time to start scanning the skies, either with a group like Audubon or on your own.It\u2019s no secret that spending time in nature is good for your mind. Studies show that even a stroll through a city park decreases stress, sharpens concentration and improves long-term mental health outcomes.A few studies suggest there might be something especially healthy about birds in particular. One, published in October, found that just being near bird song improved mental well-being.Birds are \u201caccessible and equitable, because they\u2019re everywhere in every habitat,\u201d said Holly Merker, a guide for the National Audubon Society and co-author of the book, \u201cOrnitherapy.\u201d Even dense cityscapes offer rock doves (often incorrectly called pigeons), sparrows, hawks and falcons.There is less research on the physical benefits of birding specifically, but evidence does suggest that walking regularly can help you live longer. And as any bird-watcher will tell you, the lure of the next bird inspires you to walk farther than you normally would.\u201cYou find yourself out there for what should have been 45 minutes, making a two-hour birding foray in the woods or around a loop trail at a wetlands,\u201d Ms. Merker said.No one knows this better than Ted Floyd, the editor of Birding magazine. According to his count, he has gone bird-watching for more than 5,800 days in a row \u2014 that\u2019s about 16 years. Some days, he said, he might take a 10-minute walk around his neighborhood. Other excursions can last 24 hours or involve 27 miles of hiking. He\u2019s even signed up for 10-kilometer running races because they go through good bird habitats.\u201cIf it weren\u2019t for bird-watching, I\u2019d be awfully sedentary,\u201d Mr. Floyd said.He added that he often goes more than once a day, because he might see different birds midday than he does in the morning. Breaking up your day with short exercise \u201csnacks\u201d has been shown to meaningfully improve health.Like Mr. Floyd, Ms. Watts often walks for miles, over all kinds of terrain, to see a certain hard-to-find bird.\u201cFor me, that is my fitness \u2014 the birding,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019re definitely getting a little bit of a boost, even for folks who maybe can\u2019t do a whole lot.\u201dBird-watching is simple: All you really need is a quiet place and a single bird. But for most people, it\u2019s more fun with two simple tools \u2014 a field guide and binoculars \u2014 and a rough idea of where to go.First, there is the field guide. Mr. Floyd said to look for one with maps, detailed written descriptions, photos or drawings, and arrows pointing to important markings on the birds.Most people use either National Geographic\u2019s \u201cField Guide to the Birds of North America\u201d or a Sibley Guide specific to their region of the country. The drawings in both are meticulously done to reflect what the markings on the birds look like in the field. Increasingly, birders are also turning to apps like Merlin Bird ID, created by the Cornell Lab of Ornithology. That app contains an exhaustive catalog of photos and maps and allows you to record and identify bird songs as you go.As for binoculars, serious birders can easily spend more than $500 on a pair made by Leica or another premium brand. But for beginners, a $100 set from REI will suffice. Binoculars are classified by their magnification and lens size. Start with something offering eight times magnification, which will allow you to easily scan your gaze across a tree without getting lost and won\u2019t zoom in so close that the image gets shaky. A 25-30 mm lens will be small enough to slip into a backpack pouch, but a bigger 40 mm one will allow more light on a cloudy evening. Mr. Floyd recommended a small pair of binoculars to start; if you decide to get a bigger pair later, you can still use the spare set to bird-watch from the car (be sure to pull over first).The peak time to bird-watch in most of America is sunrise in early May, during the height of the spring migration. But this is not the best time to learn. Sorting through dozens of species \u2014 singing and bickering over food or territory, hidden high in a lush canopy of leaves \u2014 will just frustrate you.The best time to start birding is during the winter, when the leaves are gone, the food is lower to the ground and only a few select species are still around. Get to know the juncos, chickadees, cardinals and jays. Learn to recognize them the way you might a new friend, through how they look, their mannerisms and what they like to do.Expert birders all agree that it\u2019s best to start birding close to home. \u201cI encourage people to find a local patch, whether that be their own backyard or a neighborhood park that they\u2019re already familiar with,\u201d Ms. Merker said.Once you can identify a few birds, consider joining a birding group for a walk. Participating in the Christmas Bird Count locally is a fun, timely option. While it\u2019s serious business for some (the results are used by scientists to track nationwide trends), all abilities are welcome and there are always participants willing to teach newcomers.If you\u2019d rather learn on your own, find a nearby trail where you think there might be a lot of food for birds. Paths around wetlands, streams and lakes are a good start, Ms. Merker said. Areas with berry bushes or forests with lots of decaying logs are also smart bets. Birds are generally most active around dawn or dusk, but if you look closely, you can spot some any time of day.Tammah Watts has developed a very sharp eye in the years since she spotted that warbler out her window. She has gone bird-watching in Cuba, spotted eagles high in the Colorado Rockies and seen tufted puffins in Oregon, at one of the few places on Earth they come to shore. But after that first magical spring, she never saw another bright yellow warbler in her backyard.\u201cFor me, they have brought healing through the way they are,\u201d she said, adding that birds can be funny, quarrelsome, serene and profoundly human. Watching birds \u201creally invites us to experience the natural world in special ways. They\u2019re like, to me, little winged gifts.\u201d"}, {"slug_name": "09WELL-FLEXIBILITY-TESTS", "section": "Well", "subsection": "Move", "title": "Can You Pass the Flexibility Test?", "abstract": "Having a good range of motion is essential for athletics as well as everyday life.", "uri": "nyt://article/672db603-69c7-5e65-8b5a-680ea14dbbe9", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/09/well/move/flexibility-test-mobility-fitness.html", "byline": "HILARY ACHAUER", "thumbnail_standard": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/01/08/multimedia/08WELL-FLEXIBILITY-TESTS11-1-bf55/08WELL-FLEXIBILITY-TESTS11-1-bf55-thumbStandard.jpg", "item_type": "Article", "source": "New York Times", "updated_date": "2022-12-13T16:30:13-05:00", "created_date": "2022-12-09T13:56:32-05:00", "published_date": "2022-12-09T13:56:32-05:00", "first_published_date": "2022-12-09T13:56:32-05:00", "material_type_facet": "News", "kicker": "why not try", "subheadline": "", "des_facet": ["Muscles", "Joints (Body Part)", "Exercise", "Physical Therapy", "Content Type: Service"], "org_facet": null, "per_facet": null, "geo_facet": null, "related_urls": null, "multimedia": [{"url": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/01/08/multimedia/08WELL-FLEXIBILITY-TESTS11-1-bf55/08WELL-FLEXIBILITY-TESTS11-1-bf55-thumbStandard.jpg", "format": "Standard Thumbnail", "height": 75, "width": 75, "type": "image", "subtype": "photo", "caption": "", "copyright": "Adria Malcolm for The New York Times"}, {"url": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/01/08/multimedia/08WELL-FLEXIBILITY-TESTS11-1-bf55/08WELL-FLEXIBILITY-TESTS11-1-bf55-mediumThreeByTwo210.jpg", "format": "mediumThreeByTwo210", "height": 140, "width": 210, "type": "image", "subtype": "photo", "caption": "", "copyright": "Adria Malcolm for The New York Times"}, {"url": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/01/08/multimedia/08WELL-FLEXIBILITY-TESTS11-1-bf55/08WELL-FLEXIBILITY-TESTS11-1-bf55-mediumThreeByTwo440.jpg", "format": "mediumThreeByTwo440", "height": 293, "width": 440, "type": "image", "subtype": "photo", "caption": "", "copyright": "Adria Malcolm for The New York Times"}, {"url": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/01/08/multimedia/08WELL-FLEXIBILITY-TESTS11-1-bf55/08WELL-FLEXIBILITY-TESTS11-1-bf55-articleInline.jpg", "format": "Normal", "height": 252, "width": 190, "type": "image", "subtype": "photo", "caption": "", "copyright": "Adria Malcolm for The New York Times"}], "body": "Bending down to put on your socks. Looking over your shoulder to change lanes. Reaching up to pluck a box of cereal from a high shelf at the grocery store.When most of us think about flexibility, we imagine a yogi with their legs wrapped around their heads or a ballet dancer doing the splits. The truth is, there are countless everyday movements that require flexibility. And being able to do them takes maintenance.\u201cFlexibility is very much a case of use it or lose it,\u201d said Dan Van Zandt, a flexibility coach and educator.Instead of shying away from movements that are painful, Mr. Van Zandt said, you can work on your flexibility and improve your range of motion. Even though most of us won\u2019t ever become flexible enough to do the splits, with time and patience we can squat a little deeper, reach a little higher and maybe even sit cross-legged on the floor.Flexibility and mobility are different but related concepts, said Andrew Pavlov, an orthopedic physical therapist and a faculty member at San Diego State University. Flexibility describes the ability of your muscles to lengthen, or stretch, and mobility refers to the ability of your joints to move through its full range of motion, Dr. Pavlov said. Combined, a lack of flexibility and mobility make things like stretching to pluck something off a high shelf or reaching down to pull a weed in your yard difficult and sometimes even painful.Flexibility and mobility are skills to be cultivated, like strength and cardiovascular endurance. And like those skills, they can improve your quality of life. Some small studies suggest that being more flexible is linked to improved sleep and less pain, as well as a lower risk of depression. According to LaDora V. Thompson, a professor in the department of physical therapy at Boston University, maintaining an optimal range of motion in your joints is also associated with good balance, strength and walking speed. And, of course, improving your ability to move smoothly and without pain simply makes many everyday tasks easier.\u201cAs you get older, as you stop getting into these positions that were once easy,\u201d Mr. Van Zandt said, \u201cthen you lose function, your quality of life becomes impaired.\u201dGauging your own flexibility isn\u2019t simply a matter of bending over and touching your toes, though that is one good test. Our bodies move and bend in many ways, and you\u2019ll need to try a few different tests if you want a comprehensive assessment.It\u2019s also important to know that with flexibility, you can have too much of a good thing. About 20 percent of the population is hypermobile, which means their joints move beyond the typical range. It\u2019s not a cause for concern unless one experiences pain or has recurring injuries. However, if you are extremely flexible, doctors and physical therapists recommend shifting your focus from stretching to building strength in order to stabilize and protect your joints.Theresa Larson, a physical therapist and expert on movement health, recommended beginning your flexibility assessment with a simple toe touch. Start by standing up with your legs straight, then bend over and touch your toes.If you can touch your toes while keeping your legs straight, Dr. Larson said, you probably have a good amount of flexibility in your lower back, hips and hamstrings. If you can only reach your knees, that\u2019s a possible sign of tight hamstrings, stiff hip joints or perhaps pre-existing spinal injuries. Some people can put their palms flat on the floor while keeping their legs straight. This might be a sign of hypermobility, or you might simply have long arms. Conversely, those with short arms might never be able to touch their toes, no matter how flexible they become.To evaluate the flexibility of your neck, sit in a chair or on the floor and turn your head to one side. You should be able to get your chin almost in line with your shoulder, about 90 degrees. Many of our daily activities, including looking down at a phone or leaning over a computer, can cause neck stiffness that interferes with flexibility.You can test the flexibility of the upper and middle part of your back by gauging your thoracic spine rotation, Dr. Larson said, with a stretch called the open book. Start by lying on your side with your legs and feet together, knees bent. Straighten both arms in front of you and slowly rotate your top arm open, keeping your lower arm, pelvis and legs still. See how far you can rotate your arm. If you can \u201copen the book,\u201d or touch your top arm to the floor behind you without moving your legs, you have adequate flexibility in your upper back. If you can\u2019t get your arm to the floor, that might be a good place to focus your stretches.Tight calves and ankles can cause Achilles tendinitis, plantar fasciitis and impact your walking gait, which can lead to injury. To test these, start by facing a wall, with your toes touching the wall. Step one foot back slightly, holding onto the wall for balance if needed, and keep the other foot planted. If it\u2019s easier, drop down onto your knee with the back foot. Then let your front knee come forward to touch the wall.\u201cIf you\u2019re able to touch the wall with your knee \u2014 without the heel popping up on that front foot \u2014 then move yourself slightly back away from the wall and keep going. See how far away from the wall you can get and still touch your knee to the wall without your heel popping up,\u201d Dr. Pavlov said.Next, get out a ruler or measuring tape. If you can move your front foot back four inches away and still touch your knee to the wall, Dr. Pavlov said, you have a good amount of flexibility in your calf and ankle. If not, you should focus on stretching your calves and ankles.The final test evaluates the external rotation of your hips, which can become very tight if you sit for most of the day.Start by lying on your back with your right foot on the ground, knee bent. Bring the left ankle to the top of your right knee and, using your hands, lift your right leg off the ground. Reach for your hamstring or shin as you bring your right leg closer to your chest. Repeat on the other side. If you can\u2019t reach your hamstring with your hands, that\u2019s a sign you have tightness in your hips.If any of these tests revealed a lack of flexibility, a good place to start is by turning that movement into a regular stretch. For example, if you weren\u2019t able to get your arm to the floor in the open book stretch, perform the stretch until you feel resistance. Then spend about 30 seconds slowly and carefully moving your arm a little bit closer to the floor.\u201cEventually you\u2019ll find the point at which the discomfort gets farther and farther into the range of motion,\u201d Mr. Van Zandt said.Stretching doesn\u2019t have to be time-consuming. Mr. Van Zandt said five to 10 minutes per week per muscle group is optimal for most people. This can be a single five-minute stretch or a few sets of 30-second stretches three to four days a week. Avoid stretching cold muscles by stretching after a workout, or warm up your muscles for five to ten minutes beforehand.If you enjoy lifting weights and dislike stretching, you can work on both at the same time by moving through the full range of motion in your workouts, like squatting with a barbell as low as your strength and flexibility allow to improve your calf and ankle flexibility.\u201cThe way you train it is entirely up to you,\u201d Mr. Van Zandt said. \u201cYou can lift weights, you can stretch, you can do a combination of both.\u201d He added that combining tends to be the most effective.Lindsay Renteria, a personal trainer and functional fitness coach, recommended the Samson stretch for its efficiency. This stretch \u2014 a lunge forward with one leg, hands clasped overhead, alternating legs after 30 seconds \u2014 targets your quads, glutes, hamstrings, hip flexors and even shoulders.The most important thing to focus on while you\u2019re stretching, said Ms. Renteria, is your breathing. While you stretch, take a deep breath in for two or three seconds, then out for two or three seconds. \u201cBreathing helps reduce stress and relaxes your body so your muscles can go through a full range of motion.\u201d"}, {"slug_name": "09WELL-MAN-THERAPY", "section": "Well", "subsection": "Mind", "title": "How to Get More Men to Try Therapy", "abstract": "Mental health experts say that many American men are in crisis.

Nearly 80 percent of suicides are among men, with males over age 75 and those who work in traditionally blue collar jobs, such as mining, construction and agriculture, having the highest rates.Despite men's higher risk of death related to mental illness, women are more likely to seek out help. In 2020, 15 percent of men reported receiving either psychotropic medications or therapy in the past year compared with 26 percent of women.This disparity in care has left experts scrambling for ways to reach more men, particularly those most at risk and who might be reluctant to talk about their mental health. Research has found that men who exhibit traditional stereotypes of masculinity, such as stoicism and self-reliance, are even less likely to ask for help.\u201cWe call some of them \u2018double jeopardy men,\u2019\u201d said Sally Spencer-Thomas, president and co-founder of United Suicide Survivors International. \u201cThey\u2019re men who have a number of risk factors and who are also least likely to seek help on their own.\u201dIn response to this growing mental health crisis, the American Psychological Association (A.P.A.) released its first set of guidelines for practitioners working with men and boys in 2018. \u201cThere is clearly growing recognition that we have to reframe mental health care and our approach to addressing the mental health needs of men,\u201d wrote Arthur Evans Jr., the chief executive at A.P.A., in an email. \u201cEarly indications are that when we do this, men are willing to engage in addressing their mental health challenges.\u201d For instance, he said, it helps to reframe therapy as an opportunity to become strong or well, rather than a treatment for mental illness.Some therapists and public health campaigns have adopted this approach and are using other unconventional messaging in an attempt to appeal to hard-to-reach men. This might include using humor or leaning into some masculine stereotypes. (Think: fewer feelings, more sports analogies.) Experts hope that once these men are in the door, they\u2019ll come to see that asking for help and going to therapy is a sign of strength, not weakness.Over the course of two years, Dr. Spencer-Thomas conducted interviews and focus groups with men who had survived suicide attempts about what might have helped them during their time of greatest need. She quickly learned that the standard communication around mental health was a turnoff for the men she spoke to.\u201cOne of the things they said was, \u2018You know that message you mental health people like to put out there, \u201cIf you\u2019re depressed, seek help\u201d? That misses us on both counts,\u2019\u201d Dr. Spencer-Thomas said.For one thing, the double jeopardy men she interviewed did not consider themselves to be mentally unwell, so language about depression or mental illness didn\u2019t resonate. Instead, they said the source of their problems was an overwhelming world \u2014 stressful jobs, financial concerns, conflicts with their partner and worries about their kids.The second issue was that these men had been conditioned to be the strong ones, the ones that other people lean on. So the idea of seeking help, especially for their minds, was a foreign and off-putting concept.\u201cI don\u2019t want to say it\u2019s harder for men, because everyone deals with their own struggles, but I think the stigma around it is that men don\u2019t need to go to therapy,\u201d said Rafael G\u00f3mez Jr., 22, who works at a software company in Los Angeles. G\u00f3mez started going to therapy after temporarily moving back home during the pandemic, something he initially hid from his parents.Using the insights from her research, Dr. Spencer-Thomas partnered with the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment and the branding agency Cactus in 2012 to develop a public health campaign, called Man Therapy, that they hoped would engage men who identify with more traditional concepts of masculinity.Man Therapy, despite its name, is not intended to be a replacement for formal mental health care. It\u2019s a website designed to educate, reduce stigma and encourage men to seek help in times of crisis. In addition to providing links to the National Suicide and Crisis Lifeline and a therapist finder tool, the website also offers a screening questionnaire to help men evaluate their mental state and self-help tips.These resources are fairly standard for mental health websites; it\u2019s Man Therapy\u2019s tone that is unique, using humor and masculine stereotypes to draw in men. Slogans splashed across the home page include, \u201cIt\u2019s OK to cry, even when it\u2019s not about sports\u201d and \u201cFeelings: they\u2019re not just for the hippies.\u201d A mustachioed fictional therapist, Rich Mahogany, who strongly resembles the \u201cParks and Recreation\u201d character Ron Swanson, guides users through the site.\u201cRather than trying to change hundreds of years of social norming for these men, we decided instead to try to meet men where they were,\u201d said Jarrod Hindman, a co-founder of Man Therapy and currently chief operating officer at Sources of Strength, a youth suicide prevention program.Man Therapy has developed numerous partnerships over the years to promote the site, including with government-funded health organizations in 15 states; professional groups in male-dominated industries, such as construction and transportation; and private mental health companies, including BetterHelp. Men might see advertisements for the site on billboards, on coasters in bars or even in bathrooms at sports arenas.A recent evaluation of the campaign suggests that it is fairly effective. Men who visited Man Therapy, as compared to a more conventional suicide awareness and screening site, were more likely to take part in help-seeking behaviors, such as starting therapy, being seen by a primary care physician for mental health reasons or participating in a mental health support group.Many men go to therapy willingly and openly. But for those who are resistant to the idea, getting them into a professional\u2019s office is only half the battle. Persuading them to talk can be another challenge.John D\u2019Agostini, 38, who runs a leadership program for young men near Minneapolis, tried going to several counselors throughout his 20s and early 30s, but he found the sessions very difficult. \u201cIt had nothing to do with them, it was me,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t have the skills and I didn\u2019t have the humility.\u201dThis type of resistance can be more common among men, said Mitch Abrams, a psychologist specializing in anger management who treats patients in New York and New Jersey. \u201cThey come in and they say, \u2018I\u2019m only here because my wife told me to.\u2019\u201dTo encourage these men to engage in the process, Dr. Abrams tries to help them see that although someone else might have initially recommended therapy, they wouldn\u2019t be in his office if they hadn\u2019t made the choice to be. \u201cThere are a lot of guys that know they want to be there, but they don\u2019t feel that they\u2019re allowed to say it because their pride is in the way,\u201d he said.Mr. D\u2019Agostini finally made progress when he found a therapist he felt he could open up to. \u201cI didn\u2019t feel like I had to keep up appearances,\u201d he said. \u201cI could just really drop it and be really honest and vulnerable with another human being.\u201dNiall Geoghegan, a therapist based in Berkeley, Calif., said when he works with new male clients, he\u2019s less likely to talk about emotions. \u201cA lot of people bristle against that stereotypical, \u2018How do you feel?\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s not always helpful for many people, but it\u2019s specifically not helpful for a lot of men.\u201dInstead, Dr. Geoghegan will begin by asking about their sleep, appetite and motivation, which can be indicators of depression or anxiety.As the therapy continues, Dr. Geoghegan said the men he sees are just as willing and able to go as deep as the women. Many men might say, \u201cI\u2019m not in touch with my feelings,\u201d Dr. Geoghegan said, \u201cbut after a few sessions, they\u2019d find things just pouring out.\u201dAnother challenge facing not only men but anyone wanting to see a therapist is finding a local practitioner who\u2019s taking new clients. Despite being located in the Bay Area, Dr. Geoghegan fields inquiries for teletherapy from men all over the country. He said that sometimes these men worry they\u2019ll experience stigma if they\u2019re seen seeking help locally, so teletherapy can be a more attractive option.The point of initially playing into traditional ideas of masculinity is to get hard-to-reach men to start to question some of the gender norms that no longer serve them, Dr. Spencer-Thomas said.Man Therapy\u2019s ultimate goal, she said, is \u201cto show these men that while those norms might work for you in some situations, they\u2019re not working here\u201d and then introduce a different approach.Dr. Abrams has a similar objective. \u201cWhat I try to do for men is I recalibrate their idea of what being tough is,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not a sign of strength or toughness to avoid problems that are destroying your life. It\u2019s a sign of toughness when you confront them.\u201d"}, {"slug_name": "08WELL-NL-HOLIDAZE-ONSITE", "section": "Well", "subsection": "Mind", "title": "How to Fend Off Holiday Stress, from People Who Should Know", "abstract": "A UPS driver, a baker and Santa\u2019s helper share advice for staying present through the season.", "uri": "nyt://article/c9ad8eb7-3a9c-526c-a854-fe867a600c1c", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/08/well/mind/holiday-stress-relief.html", "byline": "BY JANCEE DUNN", "thumbnail_standard": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/12/08/well/08-NL-HOLIDAYSTRESS/08-NL-HOLIDAYSTRESS-thumbStandard-v2.jpg", "item_type": "Article", "source": "New York Times", "updated_date": "2022-12-09T21:45:24-05:00", "created_date": "2022-12-08T20:00:09-05:00", "published_date": "2022-12-08T20:00:09-05:00", "first_published_date": "2022-12-08T20:00:09-05:00", "material_type_facet": "News", "kicker": "", "subheadline": "", "des_facet": ["internal-sub-only-nl", "Christmas", "Holidays and Special Occasions", "Content Type: Service", "Newsletters", "Santa Claus", "Anxiety and Stress"], "org_facet": null, "per_facet": null, "geo_facet": null, "related_urls": null, "multimedia": [{"url": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/12/08/well/08-NL-HOLIDAYSTRESS/08-NL-HOLIDAYSTRESS-thumbStandard-v2.jpg", "format": "Standard Thumbnail", "height": 75, "width": 75, "type": "image", "subtype": "photo", "caption": "", "copyright": "Illustration by Ricardo Santos; Photographs by Getty Images"}, {"url": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/12/08/well/08-NL-HOLIDAYSTRESS/08-NL-HOLIDAYSTRESS-mediumThreeByTwo210-v2.jpg", "format": "mediumThreeByTwo210", "height": 140, "width": 210, "type": "image", "subtype": "photo", "caption": "", "copyright": "Illustration by Ricardo Santos; Photographs by Getty Images"}, {"url": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/12/08/well/08-NL-HOLIDAYSTRESS/08-NL-HOLIDAYSTRESS-mediumThreeByTwo440-v2.jpg", "format": "mediumThreeByTwo440", "height": 293, "width": 440, "type": "image", "subtype": "photo", "caption": "", "copyright": "Illustration by Ricardo Santos; Photographs by Getty Images"}, {"url": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/12/08/well/08-NL-HOLIDAYSTRESS/08-NL-HOLIDAYSTRESS-articleInline-v2.jpg", "format": "Normal", "height": 127, "width": 190, "type": "image", "subtype": "photo", "caption": "", "copyright": "Illustration by Ricardo Santos; Photographs by Getty Images"}], "body": "Hello!

It worked for me, too, most recently before I stepped onto a crowded subway car.I\u2019ll be running in place a lot this month, as I seem to have established my own December tradition of vowing not to become stressed \u2014 and then promptly becoming stressed. This season feels more pressured than ever: Holiday socializing is largely back to normal, yet Covid is still with us and is now part of a menacing tripledemic of viruses. Inflation, travel headaches and the nagging feeling of wanting to make up for everything we\u2019ve missed out on over the past few years all add to the intensity.Well recently published an extravaganza of useful advice for surviving a variety of holiday stressors. I thought I\u2019d build on those insights by talking to a psychologist who specializes in mindfulness, as well as to a few people who know a thing or two about the holiday crush because it\u2019s built into their jobs. I wanted to know how they manage to feel present, or at least survive December with a modicum of calm. (You think you have stress? Try managing an appliance superstore on Christmas Eve.) Here\u2019s what they told me.Gerard Pearlberg, a New Jersey-based driver for UPS (which reaches peak frenzy in December) keeps his equilibrium when customers are cranky about late deliveries by being \u201cup front with them and empathetic. Empathy, not admission, diffuses the situation,\u201d he said. \u201cIt means you understand. That\u2019s generally all people want, is for you to understand their frustration.\u201dBuilding in some down time is crucial for being present and empathic, said Tom Valent, dean at the nonprofit Charles W. Howard Santa Claus School in Midland, Mich., and a Santa\u2019s helper five days a week through the season. Valent said his biggest challenge was to \u201ckeep myself at the top of my game as Santa, because a child may remember this for the rest of their life.\u201dValent takes the time and care to understand other people\u2019s perspectives, which is something we could all stand to do more of, especially at a time of year when stress can drive us to be more self-involved than usual. Sometimes a child will ask Valent a tough question that he can\u2019t answer. \u201cI\u2019ll tell them, \u2018I can\u2019t bring your mom home, but what I can do is say a prayer for you and your mom,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cI have a little book, and I ask the child to spell the person\u2019s name and I write it in the book, so they know I mean what I say, and that I care. And right or wrong in this day and age, I do say the prayer on my way home.\u201d\u201cWe all have that ability in us \u2014 to be kind and just listen, and open up, so that someone else opens up,\u201d Valent said. \u201cWe can all do better at that.\u201d That\u2019s advice I\u2019ll be bringing to the holiday dinner table.When you\u2019re in the thick of the stilted party small talk or the family bickering, pause to briefly scan your body from head to toe for incipient tension, advised Neda Gould, clinical psychologist and director of the Johns Hopkins Mindfulness Program in Baltimore.As soon as you notice signs of stress, whether it\u2019s a rapid heart rate or tense shoulders, take a few minutes to practice mindful breathing, Dr. Gould advised, which you can do anywhere \u2014 including while standing in an epic line at Target. \u201cEven in 10 seconds, we can pause, notice our senses and take a few deep breaths, and that signals to the brain and body that, \u2018OK, there\u2019s no danger right now.\u2019\u201dPearlberg, the UPS driver, makes sure his fitness routine doesn\u2019t slide during the holidays, even though working for the shipping company is a \u201chighly stressful job\u201d this time of year, he said. Stretching after work is also important, he added. \u201cI preach stretching to the other drivers. If you\u2019re going to come home and open a beer, get on the ground, have your beer on the side and stretch for five minutes.\u201dDean Reid, the general manager of a P.C. Richard & Son appliance and television store in Harlem, created a personal incentive program to get himself through the mayhem of long lines and panic buyers at his store. \u201cI\u2019ll get something sweet for lunch that puts a smile on my face and makes me feel a little better, like carrot cake or something like that,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I schedule my January vacation ahead of time, so I can think about it when things are busy. That helps me stay calm and keep rolling.\u201dShirel Ben Harroush, owner of the kosher Gratzia Bakery in Chicago, said she had already received about 5,000 orders for sufganiyot, the traditional jelly doughnut of Hanukkah. She aims to do things in advance, she said \u2014 sound advice for everyone. \u201cI ordered the supplies way ahead of time, so I have the jelly and the custard and we are ready,\u201d she said. And don\u2019t hesitate to ask for help if you need it, she added. \u201cI\u2019m hiring a guy just for sufganiyot, to make sure our customers will have their orders.\u201dI have already taken her advice. This Christmas, I\u2019m hosting my extended family for the first time and rather than cooking everything myself, I\u2019ve asked everyone to bring food. Though I do wish I had my own sufganiyot guy.If you feel your anxiety levels zooming northward in certain situations \u2014 say, the oven is on the fritz and guests are arriving in 30 minutes \u2014 Dr. Gould advises doing a quick gut check. Name the top three things that are important to you in that moment, she said, and let the rest of them go. If your priority is having time to connect with family and friends, she said, \u201cthen you get some perspective and realize it\u2019s OK if your pie isn\u2019t perfect.\u201dMost importantly during this holiday season, said Reid, the store manager, \u201cyou\u2019ve got to look at the bigger picture. You know, we made it one more year to see another Christmas, another holiday season, and you\u2019ve got to feel good about it. We did it. We\u2019re here.\u201dI loved Reid\u2019s reminder to celebrate the simple fact that we did it \u2014 no matter what \u201cit\u201d means for you. Whether this year was wonderful, or challenging, here we all are. I\u2019m so excited to be here at Well with all of you. My intention is to create a community around this newsletter, and make it a warm and inclusive place where readers feel like they\u2019re not alone. Because the personal is universal: No matter what you\u2019re going through, some other human being has had a similar experience.Here\u2019s a question to get us started: What\u2019s the best advice you\u2019ve gotten this year (about anything, not just holiday stress)? Drop me a line at well_newsletter@nytimes.com and let me know!This year, the flu virus not only arrived early, but it is also proving to be more severe than in previous years. Experts are concerned that cases of influenza will keep ramping up until January, when the virus typically peaks. Children are particularly vulnerable because their immune systems are immature. Knvul Sheikh describes the symptoms to watch out for, the most effective treatments, and when parents should consider taking their child to the doctor. Also, it\u2019s not too late to get the flu vaccine.Read more:How to Spot Flu Symptoms in ChildrenA new study finds that most adults aren\u2019t getting enough whole grains in their diet. This is especially understandable given that institutions like the American Heart Association and the FDA have different definitions of which foods qualify. Hannah Seo delves into the world of whole grains \u2014 how much you need, how to fit them into your diet, and what they are. Fun fact: Quinoa and buckwheat are technically seeds.Read more:What Are Whole Grains, Anyway?Here are some stories you don\u2019t want to miss:"}]}
